  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Data is stored on the hard disk in the form of files. When a running program requests a file, the hard disk recovers the byte content of the file and sends the bytes to the CPU, one at a time, for further processing. Measuring hard disk drive performance includes calculation of its two characteristics including the access time and data transfer rate.</p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Access time</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Access time refers to the time taken by a drive to initiate data transfer. This time depends on the mechanical nature of rotating disks and moving heads. The following are the main components added to obtain the access time:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Seek time:&nbsp;</strong>This is the time required for a hard-disk controller to find a particular piece of data. When reading or writing data, the disk heads move to the correct position through the process of seeking. The time taken to move read or write disc heads from one point to another on the disk is the seek time. The seek time is generally between 10 and 20 ms, with the common desktop hard disks having a seek time of approximately 9 ms.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rotational latency:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to the rotational delay in the chosen disk sector to rotate under read or write disk-drive heads. The average disk rotational latency is half the time taken by the disk to complete one revolution. The term is applicable only to rotating storage devices such as HDDs and floppy drives but not tape drives.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data transfer rate:&nbsp;</strong>The data transfer rate of a drive is expressed by the internal rate, which is the rate of data transfer between the disk surface and drive controller, as well as the external rate, which is the rate of data transfer between the drive controller and host system. The host transfer rate or data transfer rate is the speed at which the host computer can transfer data from the Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)/Enhanced IDE (EIDE) or Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) to the CPU.</li><li><em>The data transfer rates at inner zone ranges from 44.2 MB/s to 74.5 MB/s</em></li><li><em>The data transfer rate at outer zone ranges from 74.0 MB/s to 111.4 MB/s</em></li></ul></div>
