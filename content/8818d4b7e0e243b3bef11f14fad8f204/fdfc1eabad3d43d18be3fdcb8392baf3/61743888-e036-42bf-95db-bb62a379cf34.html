  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Developed by Stephen Tweedie in 2001, the third extended file system (ext3) is a journaling file system used in the GNU/Linux OS. It is the enhanced version of the ext2 file system. The main advantage of this file system is journaling, which improves the reliability of the computer system. It can be mounted and used as an ext2 file system and can make use of all programs developed in the ext2 file system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The maximum size of a single ext3 file ranges from 16 GB to 2 TB, and the maximum size of the whole ext3 file system ranges from 2 TB to 32 TB. The ext3 file system also offers better data integrity. It ensures that the data are consistent with the file-system state. Furthermore, ext3 is faster than ext2 because the journaling feature optimizes the head motion of HDDs. It also provides a choice of three journaling modes, which provide trade-offs between maximizing data integrity and optimizing speed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The ext3 file system is also highly reliable and has the ability to convert ext2 partitions to ext3 and vice versa without the need for repartitioning and data backup.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Command to convert ext2 to ext3:</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong># /sbin/tune2fs -j &lt;partition-name&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">For example, to convert an ext2 file system located on the partition /dev/hda5 to an ext3 file system, the following command can be used:</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong># /sbin/tune2fs -j /dev/hda5</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Features of Ext3</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data integrity:&nbsp;</strong>It provides stronger data integrity for events that occur because of computer-system shutdowns. It allows the user to choose the type and level of protection for the received data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Speed:&nbsp;</strong>As the ext3 file system is a journaling file system, it has a higher throughput in most cases than ext2. The user can choose the optimized speed from three different journaling modes.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easy transition:&nbsp;</strong>The user can easily change the file system from ext2 to ext3 and increase the performance of the system by using the journaling file system without reformatting.</li></ul></div>
