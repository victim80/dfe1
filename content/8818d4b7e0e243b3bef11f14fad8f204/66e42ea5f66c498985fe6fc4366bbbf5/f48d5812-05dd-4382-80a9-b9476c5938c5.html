  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>UNIX File System</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">UNIX File System (UFS) is a file system utilized by many UNIX and UNIX-like OSes. Derived from the Berkeley Fast File System, it was used in the first version of UNIX developed at Bell Labs. All BSD UNIX derivatives including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, NeXTStep, and Solaris use a variant of UFS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A UFS file system is composed of the following parts:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A few blocks at the beginning of the partition reserved for boot blocks, which must be initialized separately from the file system</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A superblock, including a magic number identifying the file system as UFS, and some other vital numbers describing this file systemâ€™s geometry, statistics, and behavioral tuning parameters</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A collection of cylinder groups, each of which has the following components:</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>A backup copy of the superblock</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>A cylinder group header with statistics, free lists, etc., which is similar to those in the superblock</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Numerous inodes, each containing file attributes</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Numerous data blocks</em></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Hierarchical File System</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Apple developed the Hierarchical File System (HFS) in September 1985 to support the macOS in its proprietary Macintosh system and as a replacement for the Macintosh File System (MFS). HFS divides a volume into logical blocks of 512 bytes each and groups these logical blocks into allocation blocks. Each allocation block can store one or more logical blocks depending on the total size of the volume.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The file system uses a 16-bit value to address allocation blocks, which restricts the number of allocation blocks to 65,535.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following five structures constitute an HFS volume:</p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Logical blocks 0 and 1 of the volume are the boot blocks, which include system startup information such as the names of the system and shell files, which are loaded at startup.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Logical block 2 contains the Master Directory Block (MDB). The MDB contains a wide variety of data about the volume itself, such as the date and timestamps of creation of the volume; the location of other volume structures, such as the volume bitmap; and the size of logical structures, such as allocation blocks. A duplicate of the MDB called the Alternate Master Directory Block (Alternate MDB) is located at the opposite end of the volume in the second-to-last logical block. The Alternate MDB is mainly intended for use by disk utilities and is only updated when either the Catalog File or Extents Overflow File grows in size.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Logical block 3 is the starting block of the volume bitmap, which keeps track of the allocation blocks in use and those that are free. A bit in the map represents each allocation block on the volume. If the bit is set, then the block is in use; else, the block is free.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Extents Overflow File is a B*-tree including extra extents that store information about the files and the allocation blocks allocated to them, after the system uses the initial three extents in the Catalog File. Later versions also added the ability for the Extents Overflow File to store extents that record bad blocks to prevent a machine from attempting to write to them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Catalog File is another B*-tree that holds records for all the files and directories stored in the volume. It stores four types of records. Each file consists of a file thread record and a file record, while each directory contains a directory thread record and a directory record. A unique catalog node ID helps in finding the files and directories in the Catalog File.</li></ol><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>HFS Plus&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">HFS Plus (HFS+) is the successor to HFS and is a primary file system in Macintosh.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Apple File System&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Apple File System (APFS) replaces HFS+ as the default file system for iOS 10.3 and later versions. This upgraded file system includes several features such as cloning (without using additional disk space), snapshots, sharing of free space between volumes, support for sparse files, atomic safe-save primitives, and fast directory sizing. It is used on all Apple OSes including watchOS, tvOS, macOS, and iOS.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This next-generation file system is designed to take advantage of flash/SSD storage devices and native encryption support.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">APFS overcomes the major disadvantages of the older file system, HFS+, which are a lack of functionality, low security levels, limited capacity, and incompatibility with SSDs.</p></div>
