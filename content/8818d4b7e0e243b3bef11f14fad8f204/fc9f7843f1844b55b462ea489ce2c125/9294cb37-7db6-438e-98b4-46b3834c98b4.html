  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An SSD is an electronic data storage device that implements solid-state memory technology to store data in a manner similar to an HDD. In electronics, the term “solid state” refers to an electronic circuit built entirely with semiconductors. SSDs use the following two types of memory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NAND-based SSDs</strong>: These SSDs use solid-state NAND memory microchips to store data. NAND memory is non-volatile in nature and retains memory even without power. Therefore, the data in these microchips are in a non-volatile state and do not need any moving parts. NAND memory was developed primarily to reduce the cost per bit of data storage. However, it is still more expensive than optical memory and HDDs. NAND-based memory is widely used today in mobile devices, digital cameras, MP3 players, etc. It allows only a finite number of writes over the device lifetime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Volatile RAM-based SSDs</strong>: SSDs based on volatile memory such as dynamic RAM (DRAM) are used when applications require fast data access. These SSDs include either an internal chargeable battery or an external AC/DC adapter, as well as backup storage. Data resides in the DRAM during data access and is stored in the backup storage in case of a power failure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Advantages of SSD</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The three major advantages of SSD over magnetic hard drives are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Faster data access</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Lower power usage</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Higher reliability</li></ul></div>
