  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;">A journaling file system refers to a file system that safeguards against data corruption in the event of a power loss or system crash. It maintains a journal, which is a special file where changes/updates are recorded before they are written to the file system to prevent the corruption of metadata. In case the system crashes or loses power during updates to the file system, the updates remain safe because they are recorded in the journal. When power supply to the system is restored, or when the system returns to a normal state after a system crash, those updates that were still to be written to the file system are read from the journal and written to the file system.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;">A journaling file system also restores data on the hard disk to its pre-crash configuration. Hence, the journaling mechanism eliminates the possibility of data loss. ext3, ext4, ZFS, and XFS are some of the examples of journaling file systems in Linux. Because of its stability, ext4 is the most commonly implemented file system on Linux systems.</p></div>
