  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A lost cluster is a File Allocation Table (FAT) error that occurs when the OS marks clusters as used but does not allocate any file to them. The error originates from the process used by the FAT file system to assign spaces and group files together. It is mainly a logical structure error and not a physical disk error. Lost clusters occur when the user does not close files properly or shuts down a computer without closing an application. These errors also occur owing to disk corruptions such as bad drivers and resource conflicts. OSes mark these clusters as in use, although they have no files assigned or linked to them. Disk-checking programs can examine a complete disk volume for lost clusters. To detect lost clusters, one can use a program that can save them as a file or clear them. The latter generates and links artificial files to these clusters. This method will result in damage to the newly formed file; however, orphaned data are visible, and it is possible to recover some parts of those data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Disk-checking programs can scan the computer system for lost clusters using the following procedure.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A duplicate copy is generated in the memory of FAT while noting all of the clusters marked as “in use.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Beginning from the root directory, the clusters utilized by a file are traced and marked as “accounted for” to connect them to the file. This procedure is repeated for all the subdirectories.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Lost clusters or “orphan” clusters are marked in the FAT as being used but have no link to any file.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Chkdsk.exe or Check Disk is a built-in Windows utility that helps detect errors in the file system and disk media. The Check Disk utility should be used in the case of issues such as blue screens and difficulty to open or save files or folders. This utility also checks for bad sectors and lost clusters.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Steps to use the command-line version of the Check Disk utility:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Open Command Prompt by typing cmd in the Run utility</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Enter <strong>chkdsk</strong> in Command Prompt to run the Check Disk utility in the read-only mode</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After completing a scan, the Check Disk utility will display the status of the current drive</li></ul></div>
