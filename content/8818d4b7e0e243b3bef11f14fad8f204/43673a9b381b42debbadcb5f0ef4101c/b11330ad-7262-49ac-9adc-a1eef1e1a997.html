  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Remy Card developed the second extended file system (ext2) as an extensible and powerful file system for Linux. Being the most successful file system so far in the Linux community, Ext2 is the basis for all of the currently shipping Linux distributions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The ext2 file system was developed based on the principle of data storage in the form of data blocks of the same length. Although the length can vary between different ext2 file systems, the block size of an ext2 file system is set during its creation. Its major shortcomings are the risk of file system corruption when writing to ext2, and the lack of journaling.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The system rounds up every file size to an integral number of blocks. If the block size is 1024 bytes, then a file of 1025 bytes will occupy two 1024-byte blocks. Not all blocks in the file system hold data; some must contain information that describes the structure of the file system. The ext2 file system defines the file-system topology by describing each file in the system with an inode data structure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An inode describes the blocks occupied by the data within a file, as well as the access rights of the file, the file modification times, and the file type. A single inode describes every file in the ext2 file system, and each inode has a single unique number identifying it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Inode tables store all the inodes for the file system. Furthermore, ext2 directories are simply special files (themselves described by inodes) that contain pointers to the inodes of their directory entries.</p></div>
