  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Slack space is the wasted area of a disk cluster lying between the end of a file and the end of the cluster; it is created when the file system allocates a full cluster to a file smaller than the cluster size. A large number of files and a large cluster size result in wasted disk space owing to slack space. DOS and Windows file systems use fixed-size clusters. The size consumed by a file within a cluster is independent of the data storage, although the file system reserves the entire space within a cluster for a file. Older versions of Windows and DOS used a 16-bit allocation table, resulting in a large cluster size for large partitions. For example, if the size of each partition is 4 GB, the size of each cluster is 32 KB, and a file requires only 10 KB, then the system allocates a whole 32 KB cluster, resulting in 22 K of slack space.</p></div>
