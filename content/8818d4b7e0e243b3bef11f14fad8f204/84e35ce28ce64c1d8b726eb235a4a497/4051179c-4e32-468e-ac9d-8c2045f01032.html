  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Booting refers to the process of starting or restarting the OS when the user turns on a computer system. The process includes the initialization of both hardware and software.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The booting process can be of the following two types:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cold boot (Hard boot):&nbsp;</strong>This process occurs when the user first turns on the computer. Also called as hard booting, this is required after the user completely cuts the power supply to the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warm boot (Soft boot):&nbsp;</strong>It is the process of restarting a computer that is already turned on. A warm boot might occur when the system encounters a program error or requires a restart to make certain changes after installing a program, etc.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">During the process of booting, the computer loads the OS to its memory or RAM and prepares it for use. During initialization, the system switches on the BIOS and loads it onto the RAM. BIOS stores the first instruction, which is the command to perform the power-on self-test (POST). Under POST, the system checks the BIOS chip and complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) RAM.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">If the POST detects no battery failure, it continues to start other parts of the system by checking the hardware devices and secondary storage devices.</p></div>
