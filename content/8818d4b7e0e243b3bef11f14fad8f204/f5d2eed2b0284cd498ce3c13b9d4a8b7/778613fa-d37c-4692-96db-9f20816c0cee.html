  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The extended file system (ext), or the first extended file system, released in April 1992, was the first file system to overcome the limitations posed by the Minix file system. It was originally developed as an extension of the Minix file system to overcome some of its limitations such as a maximum partition size of 64 MB and short filenames. The ext file system provides a maximum partition size of 2 GB and a maximum filename length of 255 characters. The major limitation of this file system is that it does not offer support for separate access, inode modification, and data modification timestamps. It keeps an unsorted list of free blocks and inodes, and it fragmented the file system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The ext file system has a metadata structure inspired by the UNIX File System (UFS). Other drawbacks of this file system include the presence of only one timestamp and linked lists for free space, which resulted in fragmentation and poor performance. It was replaced by the second extended file system (ext2).</p></div>
