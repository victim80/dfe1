  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Disk partitioning is the creation of logical divisions on a storage device (HDD/SSD) to allow the user to apply OS-specific logical formatting. The disk-partitioning process is the same for both HDDs and SSDs. Partitioning refers to the creation of logical drives for effective memory management, and a partition is a logical drive for storing data. Hidden partitions created on a drive can hide data. The inter-partition gap is the space between the primary partition and the secondary partition. If the inter-partition drive contains hidden data, disk-editor utilities such as Disk Editor can be used to change the information in the partition table. Doing so will remove all the references to the hidden partition, which have been hidden from the OS. Another method to hide data is to place the data, which may be digital evidence, at the end of the disk by declaring a smaller number of bytes than the actual size of the drive. Disk Editor allows an investigator to access these hidden or vacant areas of the disk.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Partitions are of the following two types:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Primary partition:</strong> It is the drive that holds information regarding the OS, the system area, and other information required for booting. In MS-DOS and earlier versions of Microsoft Windows systems, the first partition (C:) must be a primary partition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Extended partition:</strong> It is the logical drive that holds information regarding the data and files stored on the disk. Various tools are available for examining disk partitions. A few disk-editor tools are Disk Edit, WinHex, and Hex Workshop. These tools enable users to view file headers and important information about files. Both these features require the analysis of the hexadecimal codes that an OS identifies and uses to maintain the file system.</li></ul></div>
