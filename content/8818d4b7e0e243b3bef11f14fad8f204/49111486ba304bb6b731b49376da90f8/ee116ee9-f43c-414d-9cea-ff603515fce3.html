  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Clusters are the smallest accessible storage units on a hard disk. File systems divide the volume of data stored on the disk into discreet chunks of data for optimal performance and efficient disk usage. Clusters are formed by combining sectors to ease the process of handling files. Also called allocation units, clusters are sets of tracks and sectors ranging from cluster number 2 to 32 or higher, depending on the formatting scheme. File allocation systems must be flexible to allocate the required sectors to files. The allocation can be of the size of one sector per cluster. Any read or write process consumes a minimum space of one cluster.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">To store a file, the file system should assign the required number of clusters to it. The cluster size entirely depends on the disk volume and varies from 4 to 64 sectors. In some cases, the cluster size may be 128 sectors. The sectors located in a cluster are continuous. Therefore, every cluster is a continuous chunk of space on the hard disk. In a cluster, when the file system stores a file smaller than the cluster size, the extra space gets wasted and is called slack space.</p></div>
