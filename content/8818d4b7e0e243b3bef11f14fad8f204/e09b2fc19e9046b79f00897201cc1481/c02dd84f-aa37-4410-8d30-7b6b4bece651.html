  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Cluster sizing has a significant impact on the performance of an OS and disk utilization. Disk partitioning determines the size of a cluster, and larger volumes use larger cluster sizes. The system can change the cluster size of an existing partition to enhance performance. If the cluster size is 8192 bytes, the file system allocates a whole cluster to store a file of 5000 bytes. If the file size is 10,000 bytes, the file system allocates two clusters amounting to 16,384 bytes in storage space. Therefore, cluster size plays a vital role in maximizing the efficient use of the disk. The use of a large cluster size diminishes the fragmentation problem, but it greatly increases chances of unused space.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The file system running on the computer maintains the cluster entries. Clusters form chains on the disk using continuous numbers, for which it is not necessary to store an entire file in one continuous block on the disk. The file system can store it in pieces located anywhere on the disk as well as move it anywhere after creating the file. This cluster chaining is invisible to the OS. Users can change the cluster size only when reformatting the drive.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following are the steps to change the cluster size:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Right-click the drive that you want to format and select Format</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the Format dialog box, choose the allocation unit size the newly formatted drive is supposed to use. The cluster size can range from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes</li></ul></div>
