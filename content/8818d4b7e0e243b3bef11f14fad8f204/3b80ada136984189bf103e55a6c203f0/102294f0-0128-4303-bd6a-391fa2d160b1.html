  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">To protect files from mishandling and to ensure their security, the system should encrypt them. For this purpose, NTFS has the Encrypting File System (EFS) as a built-in feature. Encryption in file systems uses symmetric key encryption technology with public key technology for encryption. The user obtains a digital certificate with a pair of keys consisting of a public key and a private key. A private key is not applicable for users logged in to local systems; instead, the system uses EFS to set a key for local users.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This encryption technology maintains a level of transparency for the users who encrypted a file. Users need not decrypt a file when they access it to make changes. Furthermore, after the user has completed working on a file, the system saves the changes and automatically restores the encryption policy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When any unauthorized user attempts to access an encrypted file, they receive an “Access denied” message. To enable encryption and decryption facilities in a Windows NT–based OS, the user must set encryption attributes for files and folders they wish to encrypt or decrypt. The system automatically encrypts all the files and subfolders in a folder. To take the best advantage of the encryption capability, experts recommend that the system should have encryption at the folder level. This implies that a folder should not contain encrypted files simultaneously with unencrypted files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Users can manually encrypt a file or folder by using the graphical user interface (GUI) of Windows, by using a command-line tool such as Cipher, or through Windows Explorer by selecting the appropriate options in the menu.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Encryption is important for sensitive files in a system, and NTFS uses encryption to protect files from unauthorized access and ensure a high level of security. The system issues a file encryption certificate whenever a user encrypts a file. If the user loses that certificate and related private key (through a disk or any other reason), they can perform data recovery through the recovery key agent. In Windows 2000 Server–based networks, which maintain the Active Directory service, the domain administrator is the recovery agent by default. Preparation for the recovery of files occurs in advance, even before the user or system encrypts them. The recovery agent holds a special certificate and related private key, which help in data recovery.</p></div>
