It initializes the system hardware during the booting process. The BIOS retrieves the information stored in the complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip, which is a battery-operated memory chip on the motherboard that contains information about the system’s hardware configuration. During the boot process, the BIOS performs a POST to ensure that all the hardware components of the system are operational. After a successful POST, BIOS starts searching for the drive or disk that contains the OS in a standard sequence. If the first listed device is not available or not working, then it checks for the next one, and so on. A drive is bootable only if it has the MBR in its first sector known as the boot sector. The system’s hard disk acts as the primary boot disk, and the optical drive works as the secondary boot disk for booting the OS in case the primary boot disk fails.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bootloader Stage</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The bootloader stage includes the task of loading the Linux kernel and optional initial RAM disk. The kernel enables the CPU to access RAM and the disk. The second pre-cursor software is an image of a temporary virtual file system called the initrd image or initial RAMdisk. Now, the system prepares to deploy the actual root file system. It then detects the device that contains the file system and loads the necessary modules. The last step of the bootloader stage is to load the kernel into the memory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kernel Stage</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Once the control shifts from the bootloader stage to the kernel stage, the virtual root file system created by the initrd image executes the Linuxrc program. This program generates the real file system for the kernel and later removes the initrd image. The kernel then searches for new hardware and loads any suitable device drivers found. Subsequently, it mounts the actual root file system and performs the init process. The init reads the file “/etc/inittab” and uses this file to load the rest of the system daemons. This prepares the system, and the user can log in and start using it. Typical bootloaders for Linux are Linux Loader (LILO) and Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB). These bootloaders allow the user to select which OS kernel to load during boot time.</p></div>
