  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">APFS (Apple File System), is a file system developed and introduced by Apple for macOS High Sierra and later versions as well as iOS 10.3 and later versions in the year 2017. It replaced all the file systems used by Apple and is suitable for all Apple OSes including iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Apple File System (APFS) comprises of two layers:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The container layer:</strong> It organizes information on the file-system layer and stores higher-level information such as volume metadata, encryption state, and snapshots of the volume</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The file-system layer:&nbsp;</strong>It consists of data structures that store information such as file metadata, file content, and directory structures</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The APFS file system supports TRIM operations, extended file attributes, sparse files, fast directory sizing, snapshots, cloning, high timestamp granularity, and the copy-on-write metadata feature. It overcomes the disadvantages of the older file system, HFS+, which include a lack of functionality, low security levels, limited capacity, and incompatibility with SSDs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">APFS-formatted drives are not compatible with OS X 10.11 Yosemite and earlier versions, which makes it difficult for the user to transfer files from an APFS drive to older versions of Mac devices. Owing to the “copy-on-write” feature and “fragmentation” of copied files, the APFS file system cannot be used on HDDs. Other drawbacks of APFS include the lack of non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) support and the lack of compression and support for Apple Fusion Drives.</p></div>
