  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">As the attorney, prosecutors, and other panels present in a court of law may be unaware of the technical knowledge of the crime, evidence, and losses, the investigators should approach authorized personnel who could appear in the court as an expert witness to affirm the accuracy of the process and the data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An expert witness must consider certain factors while testifying in the court. They should gather sufficient information on standard procedures during a trial and must never query their attorney in this regard. Before the expert witness testifies in court, the attorney first introduces them to the court with high regard and discloses the expert’s credentials and accomplishments to establish credibility with the jury. However, the opposing counsel may try to challenge or question the expert’s reputation by further revealing the expert’s past failures relevant to the case, if any.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The attorney leads the expert witness through the evidence and explains the latter’s role concerning the evidence such that it is comprehensible to the jury, audience, and the opposing counsel. A cross-examination by the opposing counsel follows, who then questions the expert witness on their description of the evidence and the methods they followed while collecting and analyzing the evidence.</p></div>
