The report should be in the local language if necessary and devoid of any jargon. It should include only the data related to the case and the evidence. Every statement should have a supporting document or evidence.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The report should also give a detailed account of the incidents by emphasizing the discrepancies in the statements of the witnesses.
