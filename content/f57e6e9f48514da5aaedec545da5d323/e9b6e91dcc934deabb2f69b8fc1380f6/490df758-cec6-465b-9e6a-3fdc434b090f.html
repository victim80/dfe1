  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The rapid increase in cybercrimes, ranging from theft of intellectual property to cyber terrorism, along with litigations involving large organizations, has made computer forensics investigation necessary. The process has also led to the development of various laws and standards that define cybercrimes, digital evidence, search and seizure methodology, evidence recovery, and investigation processes. The investigators must follow a forensics investigation process that complies with local laws and established standards; any deviation/breach may jeopardize the complete investigation. As digital evidence is fragile, following strict guidelines and a proper and thorough forensic investigation process that ensures the integrity of evidence is critical to proving a case in a court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The investigators must follow a repeatable and well-documented set of steps such that every iteration of the analysis yields the same findings; otherwise, the findings of the investigation can be invalidated during cross-examination in a court of law. The investigators should adopt standard computer forensics processes; this way, the jury can replicate the process whenever required.</p></div>
