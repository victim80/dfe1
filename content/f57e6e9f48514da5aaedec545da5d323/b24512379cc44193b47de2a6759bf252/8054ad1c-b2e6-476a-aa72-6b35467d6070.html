  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A computer forensics lab (CFL) is a designated location for conducting a computer-based investigation of the collected evidence in order to solve the case and find the culprit. The lab houses the instruments, software and hardware tools, and the forensic workstations required to perform investigation of all types.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Planning and budgeting considerations</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Types of Investigations:</strong> Choose the types of crimes for the lab to investigate based on the crime statistics of the previous year and the expected trend such as criminal, civil, and corporate. If the investigation is for a corporation, then decide if it will be only internal or both internal and external. This will help in the estimation of the number of expected cases and allocation of physical resources as well as the budget.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Number of Investigators/Examiners:</strong> The number of investigators needed depends on the forensic case. Hiring trained and certified professionals is important for performing proper investigations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Equipment Requirement:</strong> The forensics lab should have both forensic and non-forensic workstations for investigative purposes. A safe locker large enough to store equipment required for the forensic investigation should be available in the lab. This will help categorize the equipment stored on the rack and help the investigator locate the necessary equipment during the investigation. Safe lockers are also a means to keep equipment safe and protect them from wear and tear, dust, and other foreign particles that may hamper performance. Keep the unused equipment on storage shelves away from the main working area to keep the lab clean and tidy.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Software Requirement:</strong> Ensure the use of licensed versions of all software required for the forensic investigation at any time during the investigation. Demo versions of forensic software are not preferable, as they offer limited functionality. Having licensed versions also helps investigators during a trial. Use a demo version if and only if it provides full functionality.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical and structural design considerations</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lab Size:</strong> Determining the size of the forensic lab depends largely on the budget and type of cases to be handled.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Access to Essential Services:</strong> There should be easy access to all the essential services of the lab, including emergency services such as the fire department and other emergency vehicles. It must also have access to shipping and receiving without compromising the physical security of the lab.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Space Estimation for Work Area and Evidence Storage:</strong> The lab must be large. There must be sufficient space to place all the equipment in the lab such as workstations and evidence storage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning:</strong> The environment in the lab such as the humidity, airflow, ventilation, and room temperature also plays an important factor. There must be a high exchange rate of air in the lab in order to maintain fresh air inside the room and prevent unwanted odors in the lab. There must be proper cooling systems installed in the lab to overcome the heat that workstations generate.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Work area considerations</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Workstation Requirement:</strong> A small-sized forensic lab generally has two workstations and one ordinary workstation with Internet connectivity. However, the requirement of forensics workstations varies according to the types and complexity of cases and processes handled in the lab.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ambience:</strong> Investigators spend long hours in a forensics lab. Hence, it is of utmost importance that the ambience of the lab is comfortable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Internet, Network, and Communication Line:</strong> Install a dedicated Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) for network and voice communications. A dedicated network is preferred for the forensic computer, as it requires continuous access to the Internet and other resources on the network. Dial-up Internet access must be available for the workstations in the laboratory.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting Systems and Emergency Power:</strong> The lab should have emergency power and protection for all equipment from power fluctuations. Lighting systems should be arranged to increase the productivity of the investigators. Adjust lighting to avoid glare and keep the monitors at an angle of 90 degrees from the windows.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical security considerations</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The level of physical security required for a forensics lab depends on the nature of investigations performed in the lab</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain a log register at the entrance of the lab to record visitor data such as the address and name of the visitor with date, time, and the purpose of the visit, as well as name of the contact person. Provide visitors with passes to distinguish them from the lab staff and maintain an electronic sign-in log for them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Install an intrusion alarm system in the lab to provide an additional layer of protection and deploy guards around the premises</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep the lab under surveillance by placing closed-circuit cameras in the lab and around its premises</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Place fire extinguishers within and outside the lab and provide training to the lab personnel and guards on how to use them, in case of a fire</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Shield workstations from transmitting electromagnetic signals, which is common with electronic equipment. The solution is to shield emissions through a process the US Department of Defense has named TEMPEST. To prevent eavesdropping, TEMPEST labs use sheets of good metallic conductors such as copper for lining the walls, ceilings, and floor. Insulate the power cables to prevent radiation and add filters to the telephones within the lab.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Human resource considerations</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The overall success of a computer forensics laboratory mainly relies on experience gathering, knowledge sharing, ongoing education, and investment in human resources development</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Estimate the number of personnel required to deal with the case based on its nature and the skills they should have to complete the tasks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Interview the appropriate candidates and recruit them legally. Ensure they have certification pertaining to their job roles.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of a computer forensics laboratory, key job roles include lab cybercrime investigator, lab director, forensic technician, and forensic analyst</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Forensic lab licensing</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Forensics labs should be licensed by the concerned authorities to indicate trustworthiness</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The authorities provide these licenses after reviewing the lab and the facilities it has for performing investigations</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Some such licenses include the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD)/LAB accreditation and the ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation</li></ul></div>
