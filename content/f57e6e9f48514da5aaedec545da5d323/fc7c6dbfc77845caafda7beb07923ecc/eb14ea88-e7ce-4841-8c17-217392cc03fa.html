  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The investigation team plays a major role in solving a case. The team is responsible for evaluating the crime, evidence, and criminals. Every team member should be assigned a few specific tasks (roles and responsibilities) that let the team analyze the incident easily. The guidelines for building the investigation team are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Identify the team members and assign them responsibilities</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Appoint a person as the technical lead for the investigation</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep the investigation team as small as possible to achieve confidentiality and avoid information leaks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Provide each team member with the necessary clearance and authorization to complete the assigned tasks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Enlist help from a trusted external investigation team, if required</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">To find the appropriate evidence from a variety of computing systems and electronic devices, the following people may be involved:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Photographer:</strong> The photographer photographs the crime scene and the evidence gathered. They should have an authentic certification. This person is responsible for shooting all the evidence found at the crime scene, which records the key evidence in the forensics process.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Incident Responder:</strong> The incident responder is responsible for the measures taken when an incident occurs. This individual is responsible for securing the incident area and collecting the evidence that is present at the crime scene. They should disconnect the system from other systems to stop the spread of the incident to other systems.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Incident Analyzer:</strong> The incident analyzer analyzes the incidents based on the occurrence. They examine the incident as per its type, how it affects the systems, the different threats and vulnerabilities associated with it, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence Examiner/Investigator:</strong> The evidence examiner examines the evidence acquired and sorts it based on usefulness and relevance into a hierarchy that indicates the priority of the evidence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence Documenter:</strong> The evidence documenter documents all the evidence and the phases present in the investigation process. They gather information from all the people involved in the forensics process and document it in an orderly fashion, from incident occurrence to the end of the investigation. The documents should contain complete information about the forensics process.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence Manager:</strong> The evidence manager manages the evidence. They have all the information about the evidence, for example, evidence name, evidence type, time, and source of evidence. They manage and maintain a record of the evidence such that it is admissible in the court of law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expert Witness:</strong> The expert witness offers a formal opinion as a testimony in a court of law. Expert witnesses help authenticate the facts and other witnesses in complex cases. They also assist in cross-examining witnesses and evidence, as various factors may influence a normal witness.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Attorney:</strong> The attorney gives legal advice about how to conduct the investigation and address the legal issues involved in the forensic investigation process.</li></ul></div>
