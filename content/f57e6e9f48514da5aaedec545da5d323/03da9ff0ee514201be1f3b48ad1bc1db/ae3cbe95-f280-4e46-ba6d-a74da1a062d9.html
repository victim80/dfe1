Therefore, the investigators should have expertise in acquiring the data stored across various devices in different forms.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Data acquisition is the use of established methods to extract Electronically Stored Information (ESI) from a suspect computer or storage media in order to gain insight into a crime or an incident. Forensic data acquisition is a process of imaging or collecting information from various media in accordance with certain standards in order to analyze its forensic value. Investigators can then forensically process and examine the collected data to extract information relevant to any particular case or incident while protecting the integrity of the data. It is one of the most critical steps of digital forensics as any improper acquisition may alter data in evidence media and render it inadmissible in the court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Forensic investigators should be able to verify the accuracy of acquired data, and the complete process should be acceptable and reproducible in the court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before acquiring the data, the investigator needs to ensure that their storage device is forensically clean and then initiate write protection to secure and protect original evidence.</p></div>
