In this phase, the investigator assesses the impact of the incident on the organization, reasons and source of the incident, steps required to tackle the incident, the investigating team required to handle the case, investigative procedures, and possible outcome of the forensic process. Case analysis is important to implement a proper plan in handling the case and achieving the desired results. Case analysis might help the investigators in determining future actions, such as the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Check if there is a possibility to follow other investigative methods to, for instance, identify a remote storage location, examine network service logs for any information of evidentiary value, collect case-specific evidence from social media, identifying remote storage locations etc.)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Gather additional information related to the case (e.g., aliases, email accounts, ISP used, names, network configuration, system logs, and passwords) by interviewing the respective individuals.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Identify the relevance of various network elements to the crime scene such as credit cards, check papers, scanners, and cameras</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Consider the relevance of peripheral components to the investigation; for instance, in forgery or fraud cases, consider non-computer equipment such as laminators, check paper, scanners, printers, and digital cameras</li></ul></div>
