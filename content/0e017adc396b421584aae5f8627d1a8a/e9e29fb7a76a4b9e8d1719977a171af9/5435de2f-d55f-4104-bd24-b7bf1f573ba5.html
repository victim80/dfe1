  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">There are several components of email communication that play specific roles when an email message is transmitted from a sender to a recipient.</p><p><strong>Mail User Agent: </strong>Also known as an email client, mail user agent (MUA) is a desktop application for reading, sending, and organizing emails. It provides an interface for users to receive, compose, or send emails from their configured email addresses.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A user needs to set up and configure their email address before using the email client. The configuration includes issuing email IDs, passwords, Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)/ Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address, a port number, and other related preferences. There are many standalone and web-based email clients such as Claws Mail, Thunderbird, Mailbird, Zimbra Desktop, Gmail, and Outlook.com. The email client becomes active only when the user runs it.</p><p><strong>Mail Transfer Agent:</strong> Mail transfer agent (MTA) is an important component of the email transmission process. It is primarily a type of mail server that receives the email message from the mail submission agent and decrypts the header information to see where the message is going. Once determined, it passes on the message to the next MTA server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">All the MTA servers talk to each other via the SMTP protocol. Some examples of MTA include Sendmail, Exim, and Postflix.</p><p><strong>Mail Delivery Agent:</strong> Mail delivery agent (MDA) is the server that receives the email message from the last MTA and keeps it in the mailbox of the recipient. Dovecot is an example of an MDA.</p><p><strong>SMTP Server:</strong> The SMTP is an outgoing mail server that allows a user to send emails to a valid email address. Users cannot use the SMTP server to receive emails; however, in conjunction with the Post Office Protocol (POP) or IMAP, they can use the SMTP to receive emails with proper configuration.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Any SMTP server is assigned an address by the mail client of the user in the following format: smtp.serveraddress.com (for example, SMTP server address of Gmail would be smtp.gmail.com).</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When a user sends an email to a specific recipient, it first reaches the SMTP server that processes the message to determine the address of the recipient and then relays it to the particular server. All SMTP servers generally listen to port 25. However, outgoing SMTP servers use port 587 for transport layer security connections and port 465 for secure sockets layer (SSL) connections.</p><p><strong>POP3 Server: </strong>POP3 is a simple protocol for retrieving emails from an email server. When the POP server receives emails, they are stored on the server until and unless the user requests it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The POP3 server does not allow the concept of folders; it considers the mailbox on the server to be its sole store. Once the user connects to the mail server to recover their mail using the email client, the mails are automatically downloaded from the mail server to the user’s hard disk and are no longer stored on the server unless the user specifies to keep a copy of it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The POP3 server can understand simple commands such as the following:</p><ul><li><strong>USER</strong> – enter your user ID</li><li><strong>PASS</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– enter your password</li><li><strong>QUIT</strong> – quit the POP3 server</li><li><strong>LIST</strong> – list the messages and their size</li><li><strong>RETR</strong> – retrieve a message, according to a message number</li><li><strong>DELETE</strong> – delete a message, according to a message number</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Since POP3 implemented email clients download mails onto the system, a user can read mails even when there is no Internet connectivity. However, because the mails are stored on the hard drive, users cannot access them from remote machines.</p><p><strong>IMAP Server:</strong> IMAP servers are similar to POP3 servers. Like POP3, IMAP handles the incoming mail. By default, the IMAP server listens to port 143 and the IMAPS (IMAP over SSL) listens on port 993.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">IMAP stores emails on the mail server and allows users to view and work on their emails, as if the mails are stored in their local systems. This enables users to organize all the mails depending on their requirements. In contrast with POP3, IMAP does not move the mail server to the user’s mailbox.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">It acts as a remote server that stores all the user’s mails in the mail server. IMAP allows email clients to retrieve multi-purpose Internet mail extensions (MIME) parts either in the form of an entire message or in multiple bits, allowing the clients to retrieve only the text part of the mail without downloading the attachment. This protocol stores a copy of all the emails on the server even if the user downloads them onto their system. As a result, users can access them from any computing system or device.</p></div>
