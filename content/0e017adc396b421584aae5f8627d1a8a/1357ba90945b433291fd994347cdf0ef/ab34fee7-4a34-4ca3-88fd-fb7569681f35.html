  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Email headers are a vital component of an email that can help investigators trace the origin of an email. These headers provide information on the sender and the recipient of the email. These details on the source and recipient(s) are provided using the headers “From” and “To,” respectively.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The headers also contain information on the path taken by an email while in transit. Each MTA that receives the email message, as it travels from its source to the destination, changes the email header section. Therefore, investigators should examine the email header section and thus obtain crucial data of evidentiary value and trace the perpetrator.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investigators can retrieve header information from any email message after its acquisition. In case they have physical access to the suspect’s system, they can use the same email program as the one used by the suspect to view the emails. The procedure for retrieving email headers differs in each email program.</p></div>
