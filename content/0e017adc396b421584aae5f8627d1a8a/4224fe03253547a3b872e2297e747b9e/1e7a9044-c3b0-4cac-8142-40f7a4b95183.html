  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Email is an abbreviation of “electronic mail,” which is used for sending, receiving, and saving messages over electronic communication systems. With growing reliance on technology, email has become one of the most popular modes of communication.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An email system works on the basic client–server architecture. It allows clients to send/receive mails via email servers that communicate with one another. Most email systems have text editors with basic formatting options that enable clients to compose text messages and send them to one or more recipients. Once the message has been sent, it passes through several servers and is stored in the mailbox of the recipient until he/she retrieves it.</p></div>
