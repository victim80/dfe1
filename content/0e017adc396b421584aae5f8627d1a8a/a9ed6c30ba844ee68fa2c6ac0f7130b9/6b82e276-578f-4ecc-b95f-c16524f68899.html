  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The process of recovering a deleted email message differs based on the email client used to send the email:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recovering Deleted Email Messages from Outlook PST</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In Outlook, email messages, once deleted, are moved to the “Deleted Items” folder. The deleted emails are stored in the “Deleted Items” folder for 14 days (a default retention period that can be modified), after which the messages are automatically deleted from that folder. In the event that these deleted emails are also removed from this folder, they become invisible to the user. However, they are not entirely deleted but moved to the unallocated space of the drive. The deleted email messages can be recovered if that unallocated space is not replaced with new data. These emails can be recovered with forensic tools such as Paraben’s Electronic Evidence Examiner (E3), if it has not been already overwritten.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recovering Deleted Email from Thunderbird</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Thunderbird stores the email messages deleted by the user in the “Trash” folder. The “Trash” folder stores the deleted email messages until they are cleared. Forensic tools such as Paraben’s Electronic Evidence Examiner (E3) can recover those deleted email messages depending on how soon the recovery is attempted. If any email message stored in the Local Trash folder of Thunderbird is deleted, its complete recovery is possible.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><em>Forensic investigators can recover permanently deleted email data from Outlook .pst files and Thunderbird using tools such as Paraben’s Electronic Evidence Examiner. Here, permanently deleted email data refer to deleted email messages that have been deleted or are lost from the “Deleted Items” folder in the context of Outlook and to those that have been deleted or are lost from the “Trash” folder as well as the “Local Trash” folder of Thunderbird.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paraben's Electronic Evidence Examiner</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Source: <em>https://paraben.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">E3 is a comprehensive digital forensic analysis tool designed to handle data more efficiently while adhering to Paraben's P2 Paradigm of specialized focus of the entire forensic exam process.
