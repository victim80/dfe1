  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The email message is a brief and informal text sent or received over a network. Email messages are simple text messages that can also include attachments such as image files and spreadsheets. Multiple recipients can receive email messages at a time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">At present, RFC 5322 defines the Internet email message format and RFC 2045 through RFC 2049 defines multimedia content attachments—together these are called multi-purpose Internet mail extensions (MIME).</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Email messages comprise three main sections:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Message header</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The message header includes the following fields:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>To</strong> specifies to whom the message is addressed. Note that the “To” header does not always contain the recipient’s address.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cc </strong>stands for “carbon copy.” This header specifies additional recipients beyond those listed in the “To” header. The difference between “To” and “Cc” is essentially connotative; some mailers also deal with them differently in generating replies.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bcc</strong> stands for “blind carbon copy.” This header sends copies of emails to people who might not want to receive replies or appear in the headers. Blind carbon copies are popular with spammers because they confuse many inexperienced users who receive an email that does not have their address or does not appear to be for them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>From</strong> specifies the sender of the message</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reply-To</strong> specifies an address for sending replies. Though this header has many legitimate uses, it is also widely used by spammers to deflect criticism. Occasionally, a native spammer will solicit responses by email and use the “Reply-To” header to collect them, but more often, the address specified in junk email is either invalid or that of an innocent victim.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sender </strong>is unusual in email (“X-Sender” is usually used instead) but appears occasionally, especially in copies of Usenet posts. It should identify the sender; in the case of Usenet posts, it is a more reliable identifier than the “From” line.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Subject</strong> is a completely free-form field specified by the sender to describe the subject of the message</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Date</strong> specifies the date of creation and sending of the email. If the sender’s computer omits this header, a mail server or some other machine might conceivably add it, even along the route.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MIME-Version</strong> is another MIME header that reflect MIME protocol’s version</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Priority</strong> is an essentially free-form header that assigns a priority to the mail. Most of the software ignore it. Spammers often use it in an attempt to get their messages read.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Message Body</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The body of the email conveys the message and sometimes includes a signature block at the end. A blank line separates the header and body. In an email, the body or text always comes after the header lines.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The email body is the main message of the email that contains text, images, hyperlinks, and other data (like attachments). The email body displays separate attachments that appear in line with the text. The Internet email standard has not set any limitations on the size of an email’s body. However, individual mail servers have message size limits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Signature</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An email signature is a small amount of additional information attached at the end of the email message that consists of the name and contact details of the email sender. It can contain plain text or images.</p></div>
