  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Email crime investigation involves the extraction, acquisition, analysis, and revival of email messages related to any cybercrime. Detailed analysis of email messages helps investigators gather useful evidence such as the date and time when the email message was sent, the actual IP address of the sender and recipient, and what spoofing mechanism was used. Investigators need to use many forensic tools to extract metadata from email headers. This helps them locate the criminal behind the crime and report the findings in order to prosecute them in the court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigations of criminal activities or violations of policies related to emails are similar to other kinds of computer crime investigations. Email crimes can be categorized in two ways: one committed by sending emails and the other supported by email. When criminals use spam, fake email, mail bombing, or mail storms to sell narcotics, stalk, commit fraud, or commit child abduction, it can be said that those emails support cybercrime.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Let us discuss in detail the crimes committed by sending emails.</p><p><strong>Email Spamming</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Spam is unsolicited by commercial or junk email. Spam mail involves sending the same content to a huge number of addresses at the same time. Spamming or junk mail fills mailboxes and prevents users from accessing their regular emails. These regular emails start bouncing because the server exceeds its capacity limit. Spammers hide their identities by forging the email header. To avoid obtaining responses from annoyed receivers, spammers provide misleading information in the FROM and REPLY-TO fields and post them to a mailing list or newsgroup.</p></div>
