It is an Internet scam that tricks users into divulging their personal and confidential information by making interesting statements and offers. Phishers can attack users by mass mailing to millions of email addresses worldwide.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The phishing attack deceives and convinces the user with fake technical content along with social engineering practices. The major task for phishers is to make the victims believe that the phishing sites are legitimate. The sources that can be impersonated include web pages, instant messaging, emails, and Internet Relay Chat. Most phishing attacks are done through emails, where the user gets an email that tricks the user to follow the given link, navigating them to a phishing website. The email may contain a message stating that a particular transaction has occurred from the user’s account and may have a link to check their balance, or it may contain a link to perform a security check for the user’s account.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following are given some types of phishing attacks:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spear Phishing</strong> is when, instead of sending thousands of emails, some attackers use specialized social engineering content directed at a specific employee or a small group of employees in a specific organization to steal sensitive data such as financial information and trade secrets. Spear phishing messages seem to be from a trusted source with an official-looking website. The email also appears to be from an individual from the recipient's company, generally someone in a position of authority. However, the message is actually sent by an attacker attempting to obtain critical information about a specific recipient and their organization, such as login credentials, credit card details, bank account numbers, passwords, confidential documents, financial information, and trade secrets. Spear phishing generates a higher response rate compared with a normal phishing attack, as it appears to be from a trusted company source.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Whaling</strong> is a type of phishing attack that targets high-profile executives such as CEOs, CFOs, politicians, and celebrities who have complete access to confidential and highly valuable information. It is a social engineering trick in which the attacker tricks the victim to reveal critical corporate and personal information (such as bank account details, employee details, customer information, and credit card details), generally through email or website spoofing. Whaling is different from a phishing attack; in this case, the email or website that is used for the attack is carefully designed to target someone in the executive leadership in particular.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pharming</strong> is a social engineering technique in which an attacker executes malicious programs on a victim’s computer or server. When the victim enters any URL or domain name, it automatically redirects the victim’s traffic to a website controlled by the attacker. This attack is also known as “Phishing without a Lure”: The attacker steals confidential information such as credentials, banking details, and other information related to web-based services. Pharming attacks can be performed in two ways, namely, Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning and host file modification.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spimming</strong> or “spam over instant messaging” (SPIM) exploits instant messaging platforms and uses IM as a tool to spread spam. A person who generates spam over IM is called a spimmer. A spimmer generally makes use of bots (an application that executes automated tasks over the network) to harvest instant message IDs and forwards the spam message to them. SPIM messages, similar to email spams, generally include advertisements and malware as an attachment or embedded hyperlink. A user who clicks the attachment gets redirected to a malicious website, which collects financial and personal information such as credentials, bank accounts, and credit card details.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mail Bombing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Email bombing refers to the process of repeatedly sending an email message to a particular address at a specific victim’s site. In many instances, the messages will be filled with junk data aimed at consuming more system and network capacity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Multiple accounts at the target site may be abused, increasing the denial of service impact. Mail bombing is an intentional act of sending multiple copies of identical content to the same recipient. The primary objective behind it is to overload the email server and degrade the communication system by making it unserviceable. Usually, a mail bomber and the victim know each other. Newsgroup postings that do not agree with the recipient’s opinion also result in mail bombing. The target in such cases can be either a specific machine or a particular person. Mail bombing is more abusive than spamming because it not only sends mails in excessive amounts to an individual but also prevents other users from accessing their email using the same server.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mail Storms</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A mail storm occurs when computers start communicating without human intervention. The flurry of junk mail sent by an accident is a mail storm. Usage of mailing lists, auto-forwarding emails, automated response, and the presence of more than one email address are the various causes of a mail storm. Malicious software code is also written to create mail storms such as the “Melissa, I-Care-For-U” message. Mail storms hinder communication systems and make them inoperable.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Let us now focus on the crimes supported by emails.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Identity Fraud</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Identity fraud is the illegitimate retrieval and use of others’ personal data for malicious and monetary gains. Identity theft is a crime that is quickly gaining popularity. It is the willful act of stealing someone’s identity for monetary benefits. Criminals obtain personal information about a person and misuse it, causing heavy financial loss to the victim. Online shopping sites that have false representations and spam emails that contain irresistible offers are the common means used to obtain the victim’s credit card numbers. Once the user has placed an order online, criminals can intercept the email message and use it. Criminals not only withdraw huge amounts of money from the victims’ accounts but can also make the victim bankrupt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cyberstalking</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Cyberstalking is a crime where attackers harass an individual, a group, or an organization using emails or IMs. Attackers try to threaten, make false accusations, defame, slander, libel, or steal the identity of the victim/victims as a part of cyberstalking. The stalker can be someone associated with a victim or a stranger.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Child Abduction</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Child abduction is the offense of wrongfully removing or retaining, detaining, or concealing a child or baby. Abduction is defined as taking away a person by persuasion, fraud, or open force or violence. There are two types of child abduction: parental child abduction and abduction by a stranger. Parental child abductions are the most common type, while abduction by a stranger will be categorized as kidnapping.</p></div>
