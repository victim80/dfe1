  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;height:normal;">Figure 11.19: Analyzing received headers</p><h4><strong>Return-Path</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">This header is used to specify the email address to which an email message will be sent/returned if it fails to reach the intended recipient. When an email fails to reach the intended recipient, it bounces. That is, it is returned to the sender of the email, unless the sender specifies a different email address where bounced emails should be sent. If the return path address and the sender’s email address differ, it is an indicator of spamming/spoofing.</p><h4><strong>Received-SPF</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) prevents sender address forgery. SPF allows organizations to designate servers that can send emails on behalf of their domains. The framework implements an SPF record, which refers to a DNS record added to the DNS zone of an organization’s domain. Within the SPF record, an organization can define the host names and/or IP addresses that are authorized to send emails from their domain. Through the implementation of SPF, the results for email exchanges can be as follows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Received-SPF: None:</strong> This means that no SPF record was found for the domain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Received-SPF: Neutral:</strong> This means that the sender’s IP address is neither authorized nor restricted from sending emails on behalf of the organization’s domain. A neutral result is treated in the same manner as a “None” result.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Received-SPF: Pass:</strong> This means that the sender’s IP address is authorized to send emails from the domain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Received-SPF - fail, or hard fail:</strong> This means that the email was rejected by the recipient’s mail exchanger because the sender’s IP address is not authorized to send emails from the domain. The SPF hard fail is executed by adding an “-all” mechanism to an SPF record.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong><strong>v=spf1 ip4 : 207.84.200.37 -all</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the above example, “<strong>-all</strong>’ means that the senders that are not listed in the mentioned DNS record (i.e., 207.84.200.37) should be treated as unauthorized and emails from them should be rejected. Only the IP address 207.84.200.37 is authorized to send emails.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Received-SPF: Softfail:</strong> This means that there is possibility that IP addresses might or might not have the authorization to send emails on behalf of the domain mentioned.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example:</strong><strong>v=spf1 include:modprod.outlook.com ~all</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the example above, the “<strong>~</strong>” symbol indicates that mails coming through any server not mentioned here will be delivered but treated as a softfail. In this case, the mailbox provider marks the message as spam or junk email. Only mails coming from Microsoft Office 365 will be tagged as SPF PASS.</li></ul></div>
