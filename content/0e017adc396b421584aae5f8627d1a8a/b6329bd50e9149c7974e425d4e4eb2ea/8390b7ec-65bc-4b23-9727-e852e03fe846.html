  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;height:normal;">Figure 11.18: Analyzing email headers</p><h4><strong>Received Header</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">The received header contains details of all the mail servers through which an email message travels while in transit. These headers are generated every time an email transmits through a mail server/MTA on its route to the recipient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever any SMTP server receives an email message, a received header is added to the email. In the email header, received headers are placed in reverse order, that the most recent or the last generated received header appears first (at the top marked by A in the figure below) and the received header that was generated first appears last (at the bottom marked by B in the figure below).</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Therefore, investigators need to start examining the bottommost received header, as it reflects information about the senderâ€™s mail server. Then, they can proceed toward the top, which will provide them data about the mail server and IP address associated with the recipient.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In the figure below, the B header is showing the domain name from which the email message originated (sonic302-19.consmr.mail.sg3.yahoo.com), the associated IP address (106.10.242.139), and the date and time in PDT.</p></div>
