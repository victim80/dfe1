  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Many users prefer desktop-based email clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple mail to send/receive emails. When an email crime is suspected to have occurred on a userâ€™s machine using email clients, the key sources of evidence are the local folders and archived files stored by these programs that hold information on all email activities. The job of the forensic investigator is to locate the local folders and extract all email messages using the right forensic tool and store the copies in a safe location.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Local email files/databases created by email clients can be saved in various locations on the suspect's computer. The investigator needs to carefully identify all the local email files and acquire the relevant email messages related to the crime.</p></div>
