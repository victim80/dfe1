A malware can inflict intellectual and financial losses to the target, which may be an individual, a group of people, or an organization. The worst part is that it spreads from one system to another with ease and stealth.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Malware forensics is the method of finding, analyzing, and investigating various malware properties to find the culprits and reason behind the attack. The process also includes tasks such as finding the malicious code and determining its entry, method of propagation, impact on the system, ports it tries to use, etc. Forensic investigators use a set of tools and techniques to conduct static analysis and dynamic (run-time) analysis of the malicious code.</p></div>
