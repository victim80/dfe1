  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Malicious programs use DNS to communicate with the C2 server, that is set up by the perpetrator. Malware uses a Domain Generation Algorithm or DGA techniques to avoid detection by reverse engineers and sends multiple DNS queries to different domains within a short period of time to connect with its C2.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A malicious software called DNSChanger is also capable of changing the systems’ DNS server settings and provides the attackers with control to the victims’ DNS servers. Using this control, the attackers can control the sites the user tries to connect to on the Internet, make the victim connect to a fraudulent website, or interfere with online web browsing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Therefore, during runtime analysis, investigators should check the DNS entries recorded on the workstation (also known as DNS cache) to understand whether the malware is trying to contact a specific domain name. They need to clear DNS cache entries from the workstation by typing <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> in the command prompt and pressing Enter, and then run the malware to identify the malicious domain name.</p></div>
