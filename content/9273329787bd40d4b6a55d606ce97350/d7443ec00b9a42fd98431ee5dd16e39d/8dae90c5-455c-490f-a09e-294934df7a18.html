  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Dynamic malware analysis refers to the process of studying the behavior of a malware by running it in a monitored environment. The environment design should include tools that can capture every movement of a malware in detail and provide feedback to the investigator. Mostly, virtual systems act as a base for conducting such experiments.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators use the dynamic analysis to gather valuable information about malware activities, including files and folders created, ports and URLs accessed, called functions and libraries, applications and tools accessed, information transferred, settings modified, and processes and services started by the malware. An investigator should design and setup the environment for performing dynamic analysis in such a way that the malware cannot propagate to the production network, and the testing system can return to a previously set timeframe in case anything goes wrong during the test. Dynamic malware analysis can be performed in two ways:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monitoring Host Integrity</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Host integrity monitoring is the process of studying the changes that have taken place across a system or a machine after a series of actions or incidents. This dynamic malware analysis approach involves taking a snapshot of the system before and after the execution of the malicious specimen using the same tools and analyzing the changes to evaluate its impact on the system and its properties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Observing Runtime Behavior</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this approach, investigators monitor the malicious activities of the specimen as it runs on the system. Observing the malware in a runtime environment enables investigators to see how it interacts with the system and the network in real-time, which helps them detect its actual functionality and purpose.</p></div>
