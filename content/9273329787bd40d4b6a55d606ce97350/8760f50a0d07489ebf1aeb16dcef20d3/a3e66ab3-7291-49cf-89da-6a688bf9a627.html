Investigators should perform process monitoring as it will help them understand the processes initiated and taken over by a malware after execution. They should also observe the child processes, associated handles, loaded libraries, and functions to define the nature of a file or program, gather information about processes running before execution of the malware, and compare them to the processes running after execution. This method will reduce the time taken to analyze the processes and help in easy identification of all processes started by the malware.</p><p><strong>Process Monitor</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>https://docs.microsoft.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Process Monitor is a monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, registry, and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Process Monitor includes monitoring and filtering capabilities, which includes the following:</p><ul><li>More data captured for operation input and output parameters</li><li>Non-destructive filters allow you to set filters without losing data</li><li>Capture of thread stacks for each operation makes it possible in many cases to identify the root cause of an operation</li><li>Reliable capture of process details, including image path, command line, and user and session IDs</li><li>Configurable and moveable columns for any event property</li><li>Filters can be set for any data field, including fields not configured as columns</li><li>Advanced logging architecture scales to tens of millions of captured events and gigabytes of log data</li><li>Process tree tool shows the relationship between all processes referenced in a trace</li><li>Native log format preserves all data for loading in a different Process Monitor instance</li><li>Process tooltip for easy viewing of process image information</li><li>Detail tooltip allows convenient access to formatted data that does not fit in the column</li><li>Cancellable search</li><li>Boot time logging of all operations</li></ul></div>
