  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Malware, a short form for malicious software, is a program that is capable of altering the properties of a target device or application for providing limited or full control of the device to its creator. A malware is useful when an unauthorized person wants to illegally access a locked or secure device.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Malware programs include viruses, worms, trojans, rootkits, adware, spyware, etc., that can delete files, slow down computers, steal personal information, send spam, and commit fraud. Malware can perform various malicious activities, ranging from simple email advertising to complex identity theft and password theft. Malware programmers develop and use it to:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Attack browsers and track websites visited</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Alter system performance, making it very slow</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Cause hardware failure, rendering computers inoperable</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Steal personal information, including contacts</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Erase important information, resulting in potentially huge data losses</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attack additional computer systems directly from a compromised system</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Spam inboxes with advertising emails</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers use malware to break down cyber security. Therefore, it is crucial for forensic analysts to have a sound knowledge of different malware programs: their working, propagation, site of impact, output, along with different methods of their detection and analysis.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The most common ways an attacker can send a malware into a system are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instant Messenger and Internet Relay Chat</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Instant messenger (IM) applications such as ICQ or Yahoo Messenger have a provision for transferring text messages and files. The malware can disperse into a system through files received during transfer using IM. The received files can contain highly malicious codes or programs as the IM applications do not have a proper scanning mechanism for the transferred files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Internet Relay Chat (IRC), on the other hand, is a chatting service that allows multiple users to connect with each other and exchange data and files over the internet. Malware such as trojans use IRC as a means of propagation. The intruders rename Trojan files as something else to fool the victim and send it over IRC. When the IRC user downloads and clicks on the file, the Trojan executes and installs a malicious program in the system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Removable</strong><strong>&nbsp;Devices</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Malware can propagate through corrupted removable media, such as pen drives and CD-ROMs. When a user connects corrupted media devices to a computer system, the malware automatically spreads to the system as well. CDs, DVDs, and USB storage devices such as flash drives or external hard drives come with Autorun support, which triggers certain predetermined actions in a system on connecting these devices. Attackers exploit this feature to run malware along with genuine programs by placing an Autorun.inf file with the malware in a CD/DVD or USB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Email and Attachments</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Invaders adopt a mass mailing technique to send out a large number of email messages, with the malware attached as a file or embedded in the mail itself. When the user opens the email, the embedded malware automatically installs onto the system and starts spreading. On the other hand, a malware sent as an attachment requires the user to download and open the attached file for it to become active and corrupt the system. Some email clients such as Outlook Express automatically execute attached files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Invaders also place links for malicious websites in the emails along with enticing messages that lure the victim into clicking the link. Most of the web clients detect such messages and sort them into harmful category. If the user clicks on such links, the browser will navigate to a harmful website, which can download the malware on to the system without the user’s consent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Browser and Software Bugs</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Users do not update the software and applications installed on their system. These elements of a system come with various vulnerabilities, which attackers capitalize on to corrupt the system using a malware.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An outdated web browser may not be able to identify if a malicious user is visiting a malicious site and cannot stop the site from copying or installing programs onto the user’s computer. Sometimes, a visit to a malicious site can automatically infect the machine without downloading or executing any program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bluetooth and Wireless Networks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers use open Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks to attract users to connect to it. These open networks have software and hardware devices installed at the router level that could capture the network traffic and data packets, and find other account details, including usernames and passwords.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>File Downloads</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers masquerade malicious files and applications with icons and names of costly or famous applications. They place these applications on websites and make them freely downloadable to attract victims. Further, they create the websites in such a way that the free program claims to have features such as an address book, access to check several POP3 accounts, and other functions, to attract many users.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">If a user downloads such programs, labels them as trusted, and executes them, a protective software may not scan the new software for malicious content. Such malware can prompt email, POP3 account passwords, cached passwords, and keystrokes to the attackers through email secretly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Sometimes, disgruntled employees of a company create a seemingly legitimate shrink-wrapped software package with malware and place it in the company’s internal network. When other employees access these files and try to download and execute them, the malware will compromise the system and may also cause intellectual and financial losses.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Beside fake software, the intruder can also construct other fake files such as music players, files, movies, games, greeting cards, screensavers, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network File Sharing (Using NetBIOS)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the users share a common network with open ports, then the malware can propagate from a corrupted system to other systems through shared files and folders.</p></div>
