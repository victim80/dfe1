  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Static analysis involves the process of accessing the source code or binary code to find the data structures, function calls, call graphs, etc. that can represent malice. Investigators can use various tools to analyze the binary code to understand its file architecture and impact on the system. Compiling the source code of a system into a binary executable will result in data losses, making the analysis of the code more difficult.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The procedure for examining a given binary without its execution is mostly manual and requires extraction of intriguing data such as data structures, utilized functions, and call graphs from the malicious file. Some of the static properties of the binary code to be examined include strings embedded into the file, header details, hashes, embedded resources, packer signatures, metadata etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Different procedures utilized for static malware analysis are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>File fingerprinting</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It examines the evident elements of the binary code, which includes processes at a document level. This process includes the calculation of cryptographic hashes of the binary code to recognize its function and compare it with other binary codes and programs from previous scenarios.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Online malware scanning</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After the hash value of a suspect file has been generated, investigators can compare it to online malware databases to find the recognized malicious code. This process simplifies further investigation by offering a better insight of the code, its functionality, and other important details.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performing strings search</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Software programs include some strings that are commands for performing specific functions. Various existing strings can represent the malicious intent of a program, such as reading the internal memory or cookie data, etc. embedded in the compiled binary code. Investigators can search for such embedded strings to draw conclusions about the suspect file.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Identifying packing or obfuscation methods</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The attackers use packing and obfuscation by using jumbled structure or a packer to avoid detection. Investigators should find if the file includes packed elements and locate the tool or method used for packing it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Finding the portable executables (PE) information</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The PE format stores the information required by a Windows system to manage the executable code. The PE stores metadata about the program, which helps in finding the additional details of the file, such as the unique number on UNIX systems to find the file type and divide information of the file format.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, Windows binary is in PE format and consists of information such as time of creation and modification, import and export functions, compilation time, DLLs, linked files, as along with strings, menus, and symbols.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Identifying file dependencies</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any software program depends on various inbuilt libraries of an operating system for performing specific actions in a system. Investigators need to find the libraries and file dependencies, as they contain information about the runtime requirements of an application.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malware disassembly</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Static analysis also includes the dismantling of a given executable into binary format to study its functionalities and features. This process will help investigators find the language used for programming the malware, look for APIs that reveal its function, etc. This process uses debugging tools such as OllyDbg and IDAPro.</p></div>
