Investigators should create an environment where they can execute the malware without disrupting or corrupting other devices.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This requires a laboratory system so that the production environment is safe. The most effective way to set up such a lab involves the use of virtualization software, which enables investigators to host multiple virtual systems running different operating systems on a single computer. Some commonly used software to simulate real-time systems in a virtual environment include:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">VirtualBox</li><li style="text-align: justify;">VMware vSphere Hypervisor</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft Windows Server virtualization</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A malware connects with networks and other systems for stealing data, getting instructions from the attacker, or copying itself. Researchers can use multiple interconnected virtual machines on a single physical computer for analyzing malware behavior on connected systems and learn about their propagation methods as well as other characteristics.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators must take precautions, such as isolating the malware analysis lab from the production network using a firewall to inhibit malware propagation. One can use removable media, mainly DVDs, to install tools and malware. DVDs mostly support read only format of data transfer and prevent malicious software from writing or copying itself onto the DVD.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators can also use a write-protected USB key. Using a malware analysis lab also enables the investigators to perform screen capturing during analysis. Additionally, it allows them to take snapshots of the laboratory system, which can be used to easily revert to a previous system state.</p></div>
