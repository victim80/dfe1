Both approaches demonstrate the functionality of the suspect malware being examined; however, the tools, time, and skills required for performing the analysis are different.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Static analysis:&nbsp;</strong>It is a basic analysis of the binary code and comprehension of the malware that explains its functions. Behavioral analysis or dynamic analysis deals with the study of malware behavior during installation, on execution, and while running.</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><em>A general static scrutiny involves the analysis of a malware without executing the code or instructions. The process includes the usage of different tools and techniques to determine the malicious part of the program or a file. It also gathers information about malware functionality and collects technical pointers or simple signatures it generates. Such pointers include file names, MD5 checksums or hashes, file types, and file sizes. Disassemblers such as IDA Pro can be used to disassemble the binary file.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dynamic analysis:&nbsp;</strong>It involves the execution of a malware to examine its conduct and impact on system resources and network. It identifies technical signatures that confirm a malicious intent and reveals various useful information, such as domain names, file path locations, created registry keys, IP addresses, additional files, installation files, DLLs, and linked files located on the system or network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><em>This type of analysis requires virtual machines and sandboxes to deter the spread of malware. Debuggers such as GDB, OllyDbg, WinDbg, etc., are used to debug a malware at the time of its execution to study its behavior.</em></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Both techniques are recommended to better understand the functionality of a malware, but differ in the tools used, and time and skills required for performing the analysis.</p></div>
