Cybercriminals have enjoyed the pleasure of being able to combine a large array of complex technologies to be successful in their mission. Due to the complexity of the attack, investigating a crime in the cyber world has become increasingly difficult to do.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Computer forensics is the process of detecting hacking attacks and properly extracting evidence to report the crime and conducting audits to prevent future attacks. It is used in different types of investigations like crime and civil investigation, corporate litigation, cybercrime, etc. It plays a vital role in the investigation and prosecution of cybercriminals.

Evidence might be sought in a wide range of computer crimes or misuse, including but not limited to theft of trade secrets, theft of or destruction of intellectual property, and fraud.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Computer forensics enables the systematic and careful identification of evidence in computer-related crime and abuse cases. This may range from tracing the tracks of a hacker through a client’s systems, to tracing the originator of defamatory emails, to recovering signs of fraud.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital Forensics Essentials (DFE) program covers the fundamental concepts of computer forensics. It equips students with the skills required to identify an intruder’s footprints and to properly gather the necessary evidence to prosecute in a court of law. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This program gives a holistic overview of the key components of computer forensics. The course is designed for those interested in learning the various fundamentals of computer forensics and aspire to pursue a career in the computer forensics field.</p></div></div>
