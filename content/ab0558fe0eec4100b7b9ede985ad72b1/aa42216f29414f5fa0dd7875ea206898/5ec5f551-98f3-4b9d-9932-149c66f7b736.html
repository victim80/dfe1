This information can help investigators in verifying the timestamps of an attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In a network forensic investigation, an investigator collects the logs of a router to correlate various events and determine details such as source and destination IPs and protocols. To perform such an examination, the logs can be redirected to the syslog server in the following manner:</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>#config terminal Logging 192.168.1.1</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In the course of a network hacking incident, or unauthorized access scenario, all logs pertaining to the attack are stored in the compromised device, which may be the router/switch, database, IDS, the ISP router, or application server. While practically all professional network devices enable the logging of events, these devices cannot store the logs for long durations due to memory constraints.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Therefore, the administrators periodically collect and store these logs separately. An investigator then may use the collected logs to identify, gather, and save suspicious logs along with the firewall protocols for investigation purposes. This process requires the analysis of logs, which can be conducted either manually or with the help of log-analyzing tools. After analyzing the logs, filters are applied to eliminate unnecessary data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Router Log Details</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Routers follow various standards for storing a log in a network, which may vary across different routers.
