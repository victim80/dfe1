While conventional network defense mechanisms are important and, to some extent, can deter attackers, they are not infallible. It is, therefore, essential for businesses to recognize the signs of a network attack, identify the defenses or security policies that were breached, and adopt measures to safeguard their network resources. Network forensic investigation refers to the analysis of network security events (which include network attacks and other undesirable events that undermine the security of the network) for two broad purposes â€” to determine the causes of the network security events so that appropriate safeguards and countermeasures can be adopted, and to gather evidence against the perpetrators of the attack for presentation in the court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This module first discusses the importance of network forensics. It then expounds on the methods of investigating network traffic to locate suspicious packets and identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs) from the analysis of various log files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand network forensics fundamentals</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Explain logging fundamentals</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Summarize event correlation concepts</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) from network logs</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Investigate network traffic </li></ul></div>
