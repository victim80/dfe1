They send a flurry of Ethernet frames with various fake MAC addresses. The switch maintains a CAM (content addressable memory) table, which the attacker is trying to gain access to. Therefore, this attack is also known as CAM flooding attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Wireshark considers MAC flooded packets as malformed packets. As an investigator, you can detect a MAC flooding attempt using Wireshark by carefully analyzing the packetâ€™s source and destination addresses along with its time to live (TTL). This can be done by navigating to Analyze <strong>-&gt;</strong> Expert Information tab and examining the malformed packets.</p></div>
