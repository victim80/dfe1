  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">As the complexity of a network increases, the number of alarms, alerts, and messages generated by applications and other devices also increases. While the previous section delved into the collection of logs and network forensic readiness, this is only a preparatory step for network forensics. It is not sufficient to merely collect data from the host, devices, and applications, as investigators also need to know when, where, and how incidents occurred. Correlating events based on certain parameters provide investigators with an insight into how the events followed and whether they relate to each other.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This section defines event correlation and discusses various types and approaches related to it.</p></div>
