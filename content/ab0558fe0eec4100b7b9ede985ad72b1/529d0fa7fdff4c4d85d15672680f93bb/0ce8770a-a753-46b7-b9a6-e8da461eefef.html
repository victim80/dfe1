  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The address resolution protocol (ARP) maps the MAC address to an IP address. In an ARP poisoning attack, an attacker changes their own MAC address to that of the target system. Consequently, all packets destined to the target system are redirected to the attacker’s machine. Attackers can monitor the data flow in the network, spoof multiple devices on the network, and cause all the packets to be directed towards them instead.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Wireshark detects duplicate IP addresses on the ARP protocol with the warning message ‘duplicate use of &lt;IP address&gt; detected’. You can use the filter <strong>arp.duplicate-address-detected</strong> after capturing the packets, to detect traces of an ARP poisoning attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The screenshot below shows that the IP address 192.168.0.54 has two different MAC addresses, which has been detected by Wireshark as duplication.</p></div>
