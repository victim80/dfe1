These techniques are called brute force attacks and dictionary attacks respectively. An investigator can detect this type of attack by monitoring the number of log-in attempts made from the same IP address or username.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The file transfer protocol (FTP) is a standard protocol to transmit files between systems over the Internet using the TCP/IP suite. FTP is a client server protocol relying on two communication channels between a client and a server. One manages the conversations and the other is responsible for the actual content transmission. A client initiates a session with a download request, which the server responds to with the particular file requested. An FTP session requires the user to login to the FTP server with their username and password. In an FTP password attack, the attacker tries to obtain the password of any authenticated user.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">You can use the filter <strong>ftp.request.command</strong> in Wireshark to detect a FTP password cracking attempt in the network. The filter provides all the FTP requests made in the network. It also displays the number of attempts made by the attacker to obtain access to the FTP server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">You should check both unsuccessful and successful login attempts to determine any password cracking attempts on FTP server. Apply the filter <strong>ftp.response.code == 530</strong> to monitor all unsuccessful login attempts over FTP. The screenshot below shows multiple unsuccessful login attempts from the source IP 10.10.10.16 to the target IP 10.10.10.50 on applying the given filter, which is strongly indicative of a brute-force attack.</p></div>
