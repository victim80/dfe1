Hence, analyzing these logs help investigators trace back the events that have occurred. Logs collected in the network devices and applications serve as evidence for investigators to investigate network security incidents. For any security event, these traces are likely to be found in logs generated from one or more layers of the network. Therefore, in order to know where to look for evidence, investigators must understand the various layers in a network as categorized by the two widely used network models â€” the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, and the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">TCP/IP is a communication protocol used to connect different hosts on the Internet. Every system that sends and receives information has a TCP/IP program, and the TCP/IP program consists of two layers:</p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Higher Layer:&nbsp;</strong>This layer manages the information, sent and received in the form of small data packets, transmitted over internet, and combines all those packets into a main message.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lower Layer:&nbsp;</strong>This layer handles the address of every packet so that they all reach the right destination.</li></ol></div>
