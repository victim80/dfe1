These artifacts include logs related to systems, applications, networks, firewalls, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The term Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) generally refers to an evidence items pointing to any security intrusion that has taken place on a host system or network. When a security incident such as an attack on network components, occurs, the activities of the attacker can be traced by examining the affected system and the log entries stored in it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Security intrusions can occur in many different forms and via various channels. Therefore, forensic investigators need to look for signs that indicate a breach, such as a sudden spike in outbound network traffic, and unusual login activities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Some of the common examples of IoCs are discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unusual outbound network traffic:</strong> Unusual increase in the outbound traffic could be a sign of ongoing attack</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Uniform Resource Locators or URLs:</strong> Malicious URLs that are often spread via phishing and spamming are considered potential IoCs</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>User-agent strings:</strong> User-agent informs the server regarding visiting deviceâ€™s OS, browser information, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Log-in anomalies:</strong> Increase in the number of failed login attempts on a user account could be sign of malicious activity</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Increased number of requests for same file:</strong> Attackers perform many requests to infiltrate a network, which leaves the traces of malicious activities</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network traffic traversing on unusual ports:</strong> Programs using unusual ports and pretending to be legitimate</li></ul></div>
