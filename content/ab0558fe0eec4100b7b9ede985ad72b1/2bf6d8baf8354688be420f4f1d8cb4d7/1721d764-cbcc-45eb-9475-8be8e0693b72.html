  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://www.tcpdump.org</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match an input Boolean expression. It can run with the <strong>-w</strong> flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, and with the <strong>-r</strong> flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than read packets from a network interface. In all cases, Tcpdump processes only packets that match the input expression.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Tcpdump, if not run with the <strong>-c</strong> flag, continues capturing packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated, for example, by typing the interrupt character, typically control-C or a SIGTERM signal (generated with the <strong>kill(1)</strong> command); if run with the <strong>-c</strong> flag, it captures packets until it is interrupted by a <strong>SIGINT</strong> or <strong>SIGTERM</strong> signal or if the specified number of packets have been processed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When Tcpdump completes capturing packets, it reports on the following counts:</p><ul><li>Packets “captured” – This is the number of packets that Tcpdump has received and processed</li><li>Packets “received by filter” – The meaning of this depends on the OS running Tcpdump, and possibly on the way the OS was configured</li><li>Packets “dropped by kernel” is the number of packets that were dropped due to a lack of buffer space, by the packet capture mechanism in the OS running Tcpdump, if the OS reports that information to applications; if the information is not reported, it will be reported as 0</li><li>On platforms that support the <strong>SIGINFO</strong> signal, such as most BSDs (including macOS) and Digital/Tru64 UNIX, it will report those counts when it receives a <strong>SIGINFO</strong> signal (generated, for example, by typing the “status” character, typically control-T, although on some platforms, such as macOS, the “status” character is not set by default; then, the user must set it with <strong>sty (1)</strong> in order to use it)</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following is an example of the output of a Tcpdump command</p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>tcpdump -i eth0</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:13:48.437836 10.20.21.03.router &gt; RIP2-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET.router: RIPv2</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:13:48.438364 10.20.21.23 &gt; 10.20.21.55: icmp: RIP2-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET udp</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:13:54.947195 vmt1.endicott.juggyboy.com.router &gt; RIP2 ROUTERS.MCAST.NET.rou</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:13:58.313192 :: &gt; ff02::1:ff00:11: icmp6: neighbor sol: who has fe80::</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:13:59.313573 fe80::26f:5a00:100:11 &gt; ipv6-allrouters: icmp6: router so</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:14:05.179268 :: &gt; ff02::1:ff00:14: icmp6: neighbor sol: who has fe80::</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:14:06.179453 fe80::26f:5a00:100:14 &gt; ipv6-allrouters: icmp6: router so</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:14:18.473315 10.20.21.55.router &gt; RIP2-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET.router: RIPv2</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:14:18.473950 10.20.21.23 &gt; 10.20.21.55: icmp: RIP2-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET udp</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:14:20.628769 10.20.21.64.filenet-tms &gt; btvdns01.srv.juggyboy.com.domain: 49</strong></p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>13:14:24.982405 vmt1.endicott.juggyboy.com.router &gt; RIP2-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET.rou</strong></p></div>
