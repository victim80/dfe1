  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The forensic examination of logs can be divided into two categories as given below:</p><p><strong>Postmortem</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators perform a postmortem analysis of logs to detect and study an incident that may have already occurred in a network or device. and This helps the investigators to determine what exactly occurred and the identify source of the event.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Here, an investigator can examine the log files several times to analyze and verify the sequence of events that led to the incident. When compared to real-time analysis, it is an exhaustive process, since the investigators need to examine the attack in detail and give a final report.</p><p><strong>Real-Time Analysis</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A real-time analysis is performed during an ongoing attack, and its results are also generated simultaneously. So, it becomes easier to respond to the attacks immediately.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Such an analysis is more effective if the investigators detect the attack quickly. Unlike in postmortem analysis, the investigator may be able to examine the log files only once to evaluate the attack, as time plays a crucial role in real-time analysis.</p></div>
