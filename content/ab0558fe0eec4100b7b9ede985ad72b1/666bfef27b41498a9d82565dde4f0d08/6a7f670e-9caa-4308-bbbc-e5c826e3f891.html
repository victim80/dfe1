It helps detect any suspicious activity or misuse, and aids in detecting the signs of an ongoing attack on the network. Investigators can identify various aspects of an attack by investigating the network traffic, such as the attacker's IP address, the device targeted, and the applications and protocols being used.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">It is effective in detecting attacks, such as DoS, malware activities, and scanning attempts, and monitoring events that are recorded on the host, such as login attempts/failures, and malicious file downloads. Suspicious packets or other information can be then singled out and collected as evidence.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Monitoring network traffic during network forensics investigation entail the following objectives:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">To detect and examine an ongoing attack by monitoring network traffic communication patterns</li><li style="text-align: justify;">To know which hosts or networks are involved in a network security incident</li><li style="text-align: justify;">To trace information/packets related to a security intrusion and collect them as evidence</li></ul></div>
