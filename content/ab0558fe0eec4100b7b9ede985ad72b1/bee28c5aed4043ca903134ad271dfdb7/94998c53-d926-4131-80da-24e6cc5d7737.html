  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://www.wireshark.org</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Wireshark is a GUI network protocol analyzer. It lets the investigator interactively browse packet data from a live network or from a previously saved capture file. Wireshark’s native capture file format is in libpcap format, which is also the format used by tcpdump and various other tools.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Wireshark allows deep inspection of hundreds of protocols and provides the opportunity to investigators to perform live capture and offline analysis. It is compatible with Windows OS, Linux, macOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and many others.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Wireshark does not require identification of the type of file the investigator is reading; it will determine the file type by itself. Wireshark is also capable of reading any file format that is compressed by using gzip. Wireshark recognizes this directly from the file; the .gz extension is not required for this purpose. Like other protocol analyzers, Wireshark’s main window shows three views of a packet. It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the packet is. It shows a protocol tree allowing the investigator to drill down to the exact protocol, or field, that he or she is interested in. Finally, a hex dump shows exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the wire.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In addition, Wireshark has other features. It can assemble all the packets in a TCP conversation and show the investigator the ASCII (or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation. Display filters in Wireshark are very powerful. The pcap library performs packet capturing. The capture filter syntax follows the rules of the pcap library. This syntax is different from the display filter syntax. Compressed file support uses the zlib library. If the zlib library is not present, Wireshark will compile, but will be unable to read compressed files. The -r option can be used to specify the path name for reading a captured file or to specify the path name as a command-line argument.</p></div>
