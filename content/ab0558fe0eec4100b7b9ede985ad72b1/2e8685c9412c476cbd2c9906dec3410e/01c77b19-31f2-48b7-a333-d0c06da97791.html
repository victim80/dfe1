  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Attacks Specific to Wired Networks</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following are the most common attacks against networks<strong>:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eavesdropping</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Eavesdropping is a technique used to intercept unsecured connections in order to steal personal information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Modification</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When an intruder obtains access to sensitive information, they might alter or delete the data as well. This is commonly referred to as a data modification attack.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IP Address Spoofing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This technique is used by an attacker to access any computer without appropriate authorization. Here, the attacker sends messages to the computer with an IP address that indicates the messages are coming from a trusted host.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a DoS attack, the attacker floods the target with large amounts of invalid traffic, thereby exhausting the resources available on the target. The target then stops responding to further incoming requests, leading to a denial of service (DoS) for legitimate users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In man-in-the-middle attacks, the attacker establishes independent connections with the users and relays the messages being transferred among them, thus tricking them into assuming that their conversation is direct.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Packet Sniffing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Sniffing refers to the process of capturing traffic flowing through a network, with the aim of obtaining sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, and using them for illegitimate purposes. In a computer network, a packet sniffer captures the network packets. Software tools like Cain &amp; Abel are used for this purpose.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enumeration</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Enumeration is the process of gathering information about a network, which may subsequently be used to attack the network. Attackers usually perform enumeration over the internet. During enumeration, the following information is collected:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Topology of the network</li><li style="text-align: justify;">List of live hosts</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Architecture and the kind of traffic (for example, TCP, UDP, IPX)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Potential vulnerabilities in host systems</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Session Hijacking</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A session hijacking attack refers to the exploitation of a session-token generation mechanism or token security controls, such that the attacker can establish an unauthorized connection with a target server.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Buffer Overflow</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Buffers have a certain data storage capacity. If the data count exceeds the original capacity of a buffer, then buffer overflow occurs. To maintain finite data, it is necessary to develop buffers that can direct additional information when they need. The extra information may overflow into neighboring buffers, destroying or overwriting legitimate data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Email Infection</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This attack uses emails as a means to attack a network. Email spamming and other means are used to flood a network and cause a DoS attack.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malware Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Malware is a kind of malicious code or software designed to infect systems and affect their performance. Attackers attempt to deceive users into installing malware on their system. Once installed, the malware damages the system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Password-based attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A password-based attack is a process where the attacker performs numerous log-in attempts on a system or an application to duplicate a valid login and gain access to it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Router attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In these attacks, an attacker attempts to compromise a router and gain access to it.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Attacks Specific to Wireless Networks</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rogue Access Point Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A wireless access point can be termed rogue if it has been installed within a WLAN without the authorization of the network administrator. Such APs are set up by both insiders and outsiders with malicious intent and can be used for data exfiltration or launching other types of attacks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Client Misassociation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A client misassociation attack begins when a client attaches to an access point that is not in their own network. Due to the manner in which wireless signals propagate through walls and other structures, a client system may detect an access point belonging to another network and attach to it, either accidently or intentionally. In either case, the client may attach to a network that is unsafe, perhaps while still being connected to a secure network. This last scenario can result in a malicious party gaining access into a protected network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Misconfigured Access Point Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This attack occurs due to the misconfiguration of a wireless access point. This is one of the easiest vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit. Upon successful exploitation, the entire network could be open to vulnerabilities and attacks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unauthorized Association</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this attack, an attacker exploits soft access points, which are WLAN radios present in some laptops. The attacker can activate these access points in the victim’s system through a malicious program and gain access to the network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ad-Hoc Connection Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In an ad-hoc connection attack, the attacker conducts the attack using a USB adapter or wireless card. In this method, the host connects with an unsecured station to attack a particular station or evade access point security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Honeypot Access Point Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">If multiple WLANs co-exist in the same area, a user can connect to any available network. Such WLANs are highly vulnerable to attacks. Normally, when a wireless client switches on, it probes nearby wireless networks for a specific SSID. An attacker exploits this behavior of wireless clients by deploying an unauthorized wireless network using a rogue AP. This AP has high-power (high gain) antennas and uses the same SSID of the target network. Users who regularly connect to multiple WLANs may connect to the rogue AP. These APs mounted by the attacker are referred to as “honeypot” APs. They transmit a stronger beacon signal than the legitimate APs. NICs searching for the strongest available signal may connect to the rogue AP. If an authorized user connects to a honeypot AP, it creates a security vulnerability and reveals sensitive user information, such as identity, username, and password, to the attacker.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Access Point MAC Spoofing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Using the MAC spoofing technique, the attacker can reconfigure the MAC address so that it appears to be an authorized access point to a host on a trusted network. Tools such as changemac.sh and SMAC are used for conducting such attacks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jamming Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">One particularly interesting method of attacking a WLAN is to resort to a plain-old DoS attack. Although there are many ways to do this, one of the easiest is to just jam the network, thus preventing it from being used. It is possible to use a specially designed jammer (radio transmitter) that will transmit signals that can overwhelm and deny the use of the access point by legitimate clients.</p></div>
