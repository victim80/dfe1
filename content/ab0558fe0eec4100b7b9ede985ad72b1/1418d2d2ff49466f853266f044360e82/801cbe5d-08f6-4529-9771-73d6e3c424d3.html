  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Event correlation is a technique used to assign a new meaning for relating a set of events that occur in a fixed amount of time. In this technique, a few events that are important are identified among the large number of events. During the process of event correlation, new events may occur and replace some existing events from the event stream.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In general, investigators can perform the event correlation process on a log management platform.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following are two examples of event correlation:</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Example 1:</strong> If a user gets 10 login failure events in 5 minutes, this generates a security attack event.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Example 2:</strong> If both the external and internal temperatures of a device exceed a threshold and the event “device is not responding” occurs, all within a span of 5 seconds, replace them with the event “device down due to overheating.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Usage of event correlator software aid in the implementation of the event correlation process. The event correlator tool collects information about events originating from monitoring tools, managed elements, or the trouble ticket system. While collecting the events, the tool processes relevant events that are important and discards events that are not relevant.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Event correlation consists of four different steps, as described here:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Event aggregation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Event aggregation is also called event de-duplication. It compiles the repeated events to a single event and avoids the duplication of the same event.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Event masking</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Event masking refers to missing events related to systems that are downstream of a failed system. It avoids the events that cause the system to crash or fail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Event filtering</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Through event filtering, the event correlator filters or discards irrelevant events.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Root cause analysis</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Root cause analysis is the most complex part of event correlation. During a root cause analysis, the event correlator identifies all devices that became inaccessible due to network failures. Then, the event correlator categorizes the events into symptom events and root cause events. The system considers the events associated with the inaccessible devices as symptom events, and the other non-symptom events as root cause events.</p></div>
