  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a variety of network-based evidence available such as the following:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Full content data</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Full content data is gathered by capturing and storing all the packets flowing through a network without any filtration. It offers a significant amount of granularity and flexibility during network-based data analysis. It helps investigators to perform a postmortem analysis of a security incident and facilitates the reconstruction of events that occurred. Investigators can use tools like tcpdump and Wireshark to analyze any subset of full content data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Session data</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Session data provides the summary of a conversation between two network devices. Although it is not as detailed as full content data, it includes an aggregation of metadata of network traffic such as the destination IP and destination port, source IP and source port, start time of the session, and information exchanged during the session.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alert data</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Alert data is triggered by tools like Snort IDS and Suricata that inspect the network traffic flow and report potential security events as alerts. However, investigators need to be careful while analyzing alert data. As these tools depend on signature-based detection, there might be false-positive alerts too, which means reporting an incident when there is none.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Statistical data</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of data provides an overall profile or summary of the network traffic, which can be of significant investigative value. Statistical data analysis can yield information such as timestamps related to network conversations, protocols and services being used, average packet size, and average packet rate.</p></div>
