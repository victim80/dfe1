  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Numerous methodologies can be applied to conduct event correlation based on log data. The following are some widely used approaches:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Graph-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>In the graph-based approach, various dependencies between system components such as network devices, hosts, and services are first identified. After these dependencies are identified, a graph is constructed with the system components as nodes, and dependencies between them as edges. When an undesired event such as a fault or failure occurs, this graph is used to detect the possible root causes of the event.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Neural Network-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>This approach uses a neural network to detect the anomalies in the event stream, root causes of fault events, and correlate other events related to faults and failures.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Codebook-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>The codebook-based approach, which is similar to the rule-based approach described next, groups all events together. It uses a codebook to store a set of events and correlates them. This approach is executed faster than a rule-based system, as there are fewer comparisons for each event.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>The rule-based approach correlates events according to a specified set of rules (condition <strong>-&gt;</strong> action). Depending on each test result and the combination of system events, the rule processing engine analyzes the data until it reaches the final state.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Field-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>This is a basic approach that compares specific events with single or multiple fields in the normalized data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automated Field Correlation:&nbsp;</strong>This method checks and compares all the fields systematically for positive and negative correlation among them, to determine correlations across one or multiple fields.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Packet Parameter/Payload Correlation for Network Management:</strong> This approach helps in correlating particular packets with other packets. It can also be used to produce a list of potential new attacks by comparing packets with attack signatures.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Profile/Fingerprint-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>This method helps users to identify whether a system serves as a relay to a hacker, or is a formerly compromised host, and/or to detect the same hacker from different locations. The approach aids in the gathering of a series of data sets from forensic event data such as isolated OS fingerprints, isolated port scans, finger information, and banner snatching, in order to compare link attack data to attacker profiles.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vulnerability-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>This approach helps map IDS events that target a vulnerable host by using a vulnerability scanner. It deduces an attack on a specific host in advance and prioritizes attack data in order to respond to the affected points quickly.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open-Port-Based Correlation:&nbsp;</strong>The open-port correlation approach determines the chance of a successful attack by comparing the list of open ports available on the host with those that are under attack.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bayesian Correlation:&nbsp;</strong>This is an advanced correlation approach that predicts what an attacker can do next after the attack by studying the statistics and probability theory and uses only two variables.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Time (Clock Time) or Role-Based Approach:&nbsp;</strong>This approach leverages data on the behavior of computers and their users to trigger alerts when anomalies are found.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Route Correlation:&nbsp;</strong>This approach helps in extracting information about the attack route and uses that information to identify further data pertaining to the attack.</li></ul></div>
