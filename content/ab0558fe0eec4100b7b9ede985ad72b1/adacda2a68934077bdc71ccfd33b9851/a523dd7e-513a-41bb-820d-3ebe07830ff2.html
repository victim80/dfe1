  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Network forensics involves the implementation of sniffing, capturing, and analysis of network traffic and event logs to investigate a network security incident. Network forensics is necessary in order to determine the type of attack over a network and trace the perpetrators. Further, a proper investigation process is required to produce the evidence recovered during the investigation in the court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Network forensics can reveal the following information:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Source of security incidents</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The path of intrusion</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Intrusion techniques an attacker used</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Traces and evidence</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Network forensics, however, is a challenging endeavor due to many factors. First, while capturing network traffic over a network is simple in theory, it is a relatively complex in practice due to many inherent factors such as the large amount of data flow and the complex nature of Internet protocols. Therefore, recording network traffic requires a lot of resources. It is often not possible to record all the data flowing through the network due to the large volumes. Again, these recorded data need to be backed up to free recording media for future analysis.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Further, the analysis of recorded data is the most critical and time-consuming task. There are many automated analysis tools for forensic purposes, but they are insufficient, as there is no foolproof method to recognize malicious traffic generated by an attacker from a pool of genuine traffic. Human judgment is also critical because with automated traffic analysis tools, there is always a chance of getting false positives results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, steps can be taken in advance to ensure network forensics readiness, such as by establishing suitable event logging and data collection mechanisms that can provide key artifacts for analysis during forensics investigation.</p></div>
