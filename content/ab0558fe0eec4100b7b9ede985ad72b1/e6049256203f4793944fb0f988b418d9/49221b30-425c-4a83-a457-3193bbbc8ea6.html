  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A firewall is software or hardware that stores details of all the data packets moving in and out of the network. It acts as first point of entry into a network and thus helps prevent hackers and certain malware from getting into any PC through a network or the internet. The software performs this task by checking information that is coming from the Internet or a network, and then either blocking it or allowing it to pass through to the PC. The firewall log file can be useful for determining the cause of program failures. In the context of network forensics, investigators can use logs to identify malicious activity. Although a firewall does not provide complete information needed to track down the source of an activity, it provides insights about the nature of the activity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The network firewall logs collect network traffic data such as request source and destination, ports used, time and date, and priority. These details help investigators correlate the data with other suspicious files to identify the source and other targets of an attack. Network firewalls come with management software that allow users to monitor logs, control security settings, and perform other maintenance tasks over the firewall. During investigation, investigators need to analyze these logs carefully based on the timings and suspicious IP addresses and examine areas such as application generated requests, DNS queries, and URLs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The log is a plain-text file and can be viewed using any text editor. In Windows, Notepad is the default text editor for most firewall log files. The period up to which the logs are stored depends on the storage limit set for the file, and newer logs replace older ones when this limit is exceeded. Due to this memory constraint, database administrators must periodically collect and store the data in the log files separately. In the event of a security attack, these logs can provide the investigators with valuable information about the breach. The investigators can then correlate these logs with other suspicious files to detect the source and other targets of the attack.</p></div>
