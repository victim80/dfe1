  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The information passing through a network is a valuable source of evidence for intrusions or anomalous connections. The need to capture this information has led to the development of packet sniffers, also called network sniffers, which are tools that can intercept and log traffic passing through the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Sniffers put NICs in promiscuous mode to allow them to listen to and capture all data transmitted over the network. Spanned ports, hardware taps help sniffing in a switched network. Sniffers collect traffic from the network and transport layers other than the physical and data-link layer.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A packet sniffer is used in network forensics because of its monitoring and analyzing features, which help to detect intrusions, supervise network components, troubleshoot the network, and control traffic. Forensic investigators use sniffers to analyze the behavior of any suspicious application or device. A few examples of sniffers and their functionalities are discussed next.</p></div>
