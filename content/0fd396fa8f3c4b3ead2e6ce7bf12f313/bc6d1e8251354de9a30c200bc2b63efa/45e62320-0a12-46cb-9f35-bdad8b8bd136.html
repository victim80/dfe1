  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">While examining Apache access.log entries for XSS attacks, investigators should search for malicious HTML tags or their hex equivalents in HTTP requests. It is likely that the Apache access log would contain numerous recorded requests. Investigators, therefore, can use the grep command to filter out logs of interest. Once the attack has been confirmed, the investigator can examine other parts of the log to gather valuable information such as how and when the attack was attempted, the website that was targeted, and whether the attack was successful.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The highlighted log entry in the Apache access.log file in the figure below shows a GET request followed by some hex encoded values in the query string. Decode the query string to determine whether it contains any malicious HTML tags.</p></div>
