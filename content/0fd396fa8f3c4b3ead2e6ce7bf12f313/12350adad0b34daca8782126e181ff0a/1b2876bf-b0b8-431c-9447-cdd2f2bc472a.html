  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Most security breaches occur in web applications, rather than in web servers, as web applications might contain bugs due to coding issues in the development phase. Consequently, web applications are prone to various types of threats, some of which are outlined below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cookie Poisoning</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Cookie poisoning refers to the modification of a cookie for bypassing security measures or gaining unauthorized access to information. In this type of attack, the attackers bypass the authentication process by altering the information present inside a cookie. Once the attackers gain control over a network, they can modify its content, use the system for a malicious attack, or steal information from the users’ systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SQL Injection</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this type of attack, the attacker injects malicious SQL commands or queries as input data. This helps them bypass the security measures of the web application and retrieve sensitive content from the database server.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Injection Flaws&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Injection flaws are the most common application vulnerabilities that allow untrusted user-supplied data to be interpreted and executed as a command or query. The attackers inject malicious code, commands, or scripts into the input gates of flawed web applications in such a manner that the applications interpret and run with the newly supplied malicious input, which in turn allows the attackers to extract sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Such injection flaws are commonly found in in SQL, NoSQL, and LDAP queries as well as OS commands. Injection flaws have been regarded as the topmost security vulnerability in web applications in 2017 by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cross Site Request Forgery</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this attack method, an authenticated user is made to perform certain tasks on the web application that is chosen by an attacker. For example, an attacker can make a user click on a particular link sent via email or chat.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Path/Directory Traversal</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When attackers exploit HTTP by using directory traversal, they gain unauthorized access to directories, following which they may execute commands outside the web server’s root directory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unvalidated Input&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this type of attack, attackers tamper with the URL, HTTP requests, headers, hidden fields, form fields, query strings, etc. to bypass a security measures in a system. User login IDs and other related data get stored in cookies, which become a source of attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Examples of attacks that cause unvalidated input include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cross Site Scripting</strong><strong>(XSS)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this type of attack, the attackers bypass the client’s ID security mechanisms and gain access privileges. Subsequently, they inject the malicious scripts into specific fields in the web pages. These malicious XSS scripts can rewrite the HTML content of a website, hijack user sessions or redirect users to malicious websites, and deface website. XSS is one of OWASP’s top 10 web application security vulnerabilities for 2017.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sensitive Data Exposure&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Sensitive information, such as account records, credit-card numbers, passwords, or other authenticated information are generally stored by web applications either in a database or on a file system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">If the developers make any mistakes while enforcing encryption techniques on a web application or ignore the security aspects of some parts of the application, attackers can easily exploit those flaws to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Sensitive data can be exploited and misused by both insiders and outsiders to perform identity theft, credit-card fraud, and other cybercrimes. This threat is included in OWASP top 10 security vulnerabilities for 2017.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parameter/Form Tampering</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This type of tampering attack aims at manipulating the communication parameters exchanged between a client and server to make changes in application data, such as user IDs and passwords with event logs or the cost and quantity of products.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In order to improve the functionality and control of the application, the system collects such information and stores it in hidden form fields, cookies, or URL query strings.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Hackers use tools such as WebScarab and Paros proxy to launch this type of attack. Successful exploitation might lead to other attacks such as file inclusion and XSS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A denial of service (DoS) attack aims at terminating the operations of a website or server by making its resources unavailable to clients.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">For example, a DoS attack may shut down the functioning of a website related to banking or an email service for a few hours or even days, resulting in the loss of both time and money.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Broken Access Control</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This is a method in which an attacker identifies a flaw in access-control policies and exploits it to bypass the authentication mechanism. This enables the attacker to gain access to sensitive data, modify access rights, or operate accounts of other users. This is a part of 2017 OWASP top 10 security vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Misconfiguration</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The lack of a repeatable security-hardening process at any layer of the application stack, which includes web servers, databases, frameworks, host OSes, application servers, and storage devices, can lead to a security misconfiguration vulnerability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The use of default configurations, passwords, or out-of-date software can increase the risk of an attack. This is included in OWASP 2017 top 10 security vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Information Leakage</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Information leakage refers to a drawback in a web application where the application unintentionally reveals sensitive information to an unauthorized user. Such information leakage can cause great losses to a company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Hence, the company needs to employ proper content filtering mechanisms to protect all its information or data sources, such as systems or other network resources, from information leakage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improper Error Handling&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This threat arises when a web application is unable to handle internal errors properly. In such cases, the website returns information, such as database dumps, stack traces, and error codes, in the form of errors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Buffer Overflow</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The buffer overflow of a web application occurs when it fails to guard its buffer properly and allows writing beyond its maximum size. Thus, it overwrites adjacent memory locations. There are multiple forms of buffer overflow, including heap buffer overflows and format string attacks. The purpose of these attacks is to corrupt the execution stack of the web application.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Log files keep records of the actions and events that occur while an application/service is running. This vulnerability occurs when the logs do not record security-critical events or provide unclear warnings or error messages.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The lack of log monitoring or the maintenance of logs at insecure locations greatly increases the chance of a major security incident.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Moreover, insufficient logging and monitoring practices leave no audit trail for forensic analysis, making the detection of any malicious behavior exceedingly difficult for forensic investigators. It is one of 2017 OWASP’s top 10 web application security vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Broken Authentication </strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers exploit implementation flaws in the authentication and session management functions of a web application to obtain administrative privileges or impersonate other users. Common vulnerable areas include timeouts, secret questions, and password management. Broken authentication is one of OWASP’s top 10 web application security vulnerabilities for 2017.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Log Tampering</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Web applications maintain logs to track the usage patterns, such as admin login credentials and user login credentials. The attackers usually inject, delete or tamper the web application logs to engage in malicious activities or hide their identities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insecure Direct Object References</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An insecure direct object reference occurs when developers expose various internal implementation objects such as files, directories, database records, and key-through references. For example, if a bank account number is a primary key, there is a chance of attackers compromising the application and taking advantage of such references.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insufficient Transport Layer Protection</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Developers need to enforce Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology for website authentication. Failing to implement this technology enables attackers to access session cookies by monitoring the network flow. Various attacks such as phishing attacks, account theft, and privilege escalation may occur after attackers gain access to the cookies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Failure to Restrict URL Access</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An application often safeguards or protects sensitive functionality and prevents the display of links or URLs for protection. Failure to restrict URL access refers to a vulnerability in which a web application is unable to restrict a hacker from accessing a particular URL.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Here, an attacker attempts to bypass website security by using techniques such as forced browsing and gains unauthorized access to specific web pages or other data files containing sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insecure or Improper Cryptographic Storage</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The sensitive data stored in a database should be properly encrypted using cryptography. However, some cryptographic encryption methods contain inherent vulnerabilities. Therefore, developers should use strong encryption methods to develop secure applications.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In addition, they must securely store cryptographic keys so that attackers cannot easily obtain them and decrypt the sensitive data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insecure Deserialization</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Serialization and deserialization are effective processes that enable data structures to be stored or transmitted to other locations, such as networks or systems, while preserving the state of the object.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The insecure deserialization vulnerability arises when applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) allow the deserialization of untrusted user input.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers inject malicious code into a serialized form of data, and upon deserialization, the manipulated data as well as the malicious code get executed, enabling attackers to gain access to any system remotely and perform further malicious activities. This attack is one of OWASP’s 2017 top 10 web application security vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cookie Snooping&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">By using a local proxy, an attacker can decode or crack user credentials. Once the attacker gains these plaintext credentials, they log into the system as a legitimate user and gain access to unauthorized information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>XML External Entities&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this attack, the attacker provides a malicious XML input including an external entity reference to the target web application. When this malicious input is processed by a poorly configured XML parser, attackers can access sensitive data files and network resources from target web servers and connected networks. This attack is one of OWASP’s top 10 web application security vulnerabilities for 2017.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Management Exploits</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Some attackers target security management systems, either on networks or on the application layer, to modify or disable security enforcement. An attacker who exploits security management can directly modify protection policies, delete existing policies, add new policies, and modify applications, system data, and resources.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Authentication Hijacking&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">All web applications rely on information such as passwords and user IDs for user identification. In this type of attack, the attackers attempt to hijack these credentials using various attack techniques such as sniffing and social engineering. Upon obtaining these credentials, they perform various malicious acts, including session hijacking, service theft, and user impersonation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this type of attack, the attackers lure the victim and make them click on unvalidated links that appear legitimate. Such redirects may lead to the installation of malware or trick the victims into sharing their passwords or other sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Such unsafe links may lead to access-control bypassing, which further results in the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Session fixation attacks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Security management exploits</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Failure to restrict URL access</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Malicious file execution</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Session Fixation Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This type of attack assists the attacker in hijacking a valid user session. The attacker hijacks the user-validated session, with prior knowledge of the user ID for the session by authenticating with a known session ID.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In this type of attack, the attacker tricks the user into accessing a genuine web server using an explicit session ID value. Subsequently, the attacker assumes the identity of the victim and exploits those credentials at the server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The steps involved are as follows:</p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The attacker visits the bank website and logs in using his credentials</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The web server sets a session ID on the attacker’s machine</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The attacker sends an email to the victim that contains a link with a fixed session ID</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The victim clicks the link and is redirected to the bank website</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The victim logs into the server using their credentials and fixed session ID</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The attacker logs into the server using the victim’s credentials with the same session ID</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CAPTCHA Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Implementing CAPTCHAs prevents automated software from performing actions that degrade the quality of service of a given system through abuse or excessive resource expenditure. CAPTCHAs aim at ensuring that the users of applications are human and ultimately aid in preventing unauthorized access and abuse.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Each CAPTCHA implementation derives its strength by increasing the system’s complexity to perform segmentation, image preprocessing, and classification.</p></div>
