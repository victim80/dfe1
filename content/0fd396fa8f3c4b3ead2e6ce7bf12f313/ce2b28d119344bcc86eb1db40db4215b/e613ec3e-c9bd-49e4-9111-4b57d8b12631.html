  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Web applications are programs existing on a central server that permit a user, who visits a website via the Internet, to submit and retrieve data to and from a database. A client makes a request to a web server via a web application. When the server responds to the request, the web application generates documents of the response for better client/user service.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The web documents generated by web applications are in a standard format, such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML), which is supported by all types of browsers. Web applications accomplish the requested task irrespective of the OS and browser deployed by the user. Despite the advantages of web applications, they tend to be vulnerable to attacks owing to improper coding or security-monitoring practices. Attackers attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the code and gain access to the database contents, thereby gaining access to sensitive information such as user credentials and bank account details. Some types of attacks performed on web applications include SQL injection, XSS, session hijacking, local and remote file inclusions, and remote code execution.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Web application forensics assumes prominence when such kinds of attacks occur on web applications. It involves the forensic examination of web applications and its contents (such as logs, www directory, and config files) to trace and identify the origin of the attack, determine how the attack was propagated, along with the devices used (mobile devices and computers), and persons involved in the attack. The investigators examine the logs and configuration files associated with server, network, and host machine to gain insight into the attack.</p></div>
