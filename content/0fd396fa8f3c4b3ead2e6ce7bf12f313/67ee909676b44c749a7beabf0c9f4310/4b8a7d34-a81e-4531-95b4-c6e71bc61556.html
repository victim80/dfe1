  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">There are different components that indicate a web attack. For example, in a DoS attack, customers are denied access to the information or services available on the target web server. In such cases, customers report the unavailability of online services because the attacker prevents legitimate users from accessing websites, and other services that rely on the targeted web server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Redirecting a user on a web page to an unknown website which hosts an exploit kit is another indication of a web attack. When a user enters the website’s URL in the address bar, the server redirects them to an unknown (often malicious) site, which installs spyware/malware in the user’s machine.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Unusually slow network performance and frequent rebooting of the server can also indicate a web attack. Anomalies found in the log files are also an indication of web attacks. A change in a password and the creation of a new user account can reveal the attack attempts in websites. Other indicators of web attacks include leakage of sensitive data and web page defacements.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">There may be other indicators, such as the returning of error messages. For example, an HTTP 500 error message page may indicate the occurrence of an SQL injection attack. Additionally, there are other error messages, such as “an internal server error” and “problem processing your request,” that indicate a web attack.</p></div>
