  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Digital devices used in cyberattacks and other security breaches may store some data about the session, such as login user, time, type of connection, and IP addresses, which can offer evidence for prosecuting the attacker. Digital evidence includes all such information that is either stored or transmitted in digital form and has probative value, thus helping investigators find the perpetrator.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Digital evidence can be found across computing devices, servers, routers, etc. It is revealed during forensics investigation while examining digital storage media, monitoring the network traffic, or making duplicate copies of digital data. Investigators should take utmost care while gathering and extracting the digital evidence as such evidence is fragile. This makes it difficult for a forensic investigator to trace criminal activities. Investigators should be trained and skilled to extract, handle, and analyze such fragile evidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Locard's Exchange Principle, “anyone or anything entering a crime scene takes something of the scene with them and leaves something of themselves behind when they leave.” For example, if information from a victim’s computer is stored on the server or system itself at the time of the crime, the investigator can easily obtain this information by examining log files, Internet browsing history, and so on. Similarly, if an individual sends an intimidating message via an Internet-based e-mail service such as Hotmail, Gmail, or Yahoo Mail, both the victim and the actor’s systems may store files, links, and other information that forensic investigators can extract and analyze.</p></div>
