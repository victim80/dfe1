  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://www.swgde.org</em></p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Principle 1</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">“In order to ensure that digital evidence is collected, preserved, examined, or transferred in a manner that safeguards the accuracy and reliability of the evidence, law enforcement and forensic organizations must establish and maintain an effective quality system.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">“Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are documented quality-control guidelines that must be supported by proper case records and broadly accepted procedures, equipment, and materials.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Implementation of SOPs allows you to operate company-compliant policies and plans. It is important that no modifications are made to SOPs before implementation to achieve the desired outputs. However, if any modifications are required, they must be communicated before starting an investigation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.1</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">All agencies that seize and/or examine digital evidence must maintain an appropriate SOP document. All elements of an agency’s policies and procedures concerning digital evidence must be clearly set forth in this SOP document, which must be issued under the agency’s management authority.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> The use of SOPs is fundamental to both law enforcement and forensic science. Guidelines that are consistent with scientific and legal principles are essential to the acceptance of results and conclusions by courts and other agencies. The development and implementation of these SOPs must be under an agency’s management authority.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.2</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Agency management must review the SOPs on an annual basis to ensure their continued suitability and effectiveness.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> Rapid technological changes are the hallmark of digital evidence, wherein the types, formats, and methods for seizing and examining digital evidence change quickly. To ensure that personnel, training, equipment, and procedures continue to be appropriate and effective, the management must review and update SOP documents annually.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.3</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Procedures used must be generally accepted in the field or supported by data gathered and recorded scientifically.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> As a variety of scientific procedures may validly be applied to a given problem, standards and criteria for assessing procedures need to be flexible. The validity of a procedure may be established by demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of specific techniques. In the digital evidence area, peer review of SOPs by other agencies may be useful.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.4</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The agency must maintain written copies of appropriate technical procedures.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> Procedures should set forth their purpose and appropriate application. Required elements such as hardware and software must be listed, and the proper steps for successful use should be listed or discussed. Any limitations in the use of the procedure or the use or interpretation of the results should be established. Personnel who use these procedures must be familiar with them and have them available for reference.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.5</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The agency must use hardware and software that are appropriate and effective for the seizure or examination procedure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> Although many acceptable procedures may be used to perform a task, considerable variation among cases requires that personnel have the flexibility to exercise judgment in selecting a method appropriate to the problem.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Hardware used in the seizure and/or examination of digital evidence should be in good operating condition and be tested to ensure that it operates correctly. The software must be tested to ensure that it produces reliable results for use in seizure and/or examination purposes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.6</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">All activity related to the seizure, storage, examination, or transfer of digital evidence must be recorded in writing and be available for review and testimony.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> In general, documentation to support conclusions must be such that, in the absence of the originator, another competent person can evaluate what was done, interpret the data, and arrive at the same conclusions as the originator.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The requirement for evidence reliability necessitates a chain of custody for all items of evidence. Chain-of-custody documentation must be maintained for all digital evidence. Case notes and records of observations must be permanent. Handwritten notes and observations must be in ink, not pencil, although pencil (including color) may be appropriate for diagrams or making tracings. Any corrections to notes must be made by an initialed, single strikeout; nothing in the handwritten information should be obliterated or erased. Notes and records should be authenticated by handwritten signatures, initials, digital signatures, or other marking systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Standards and Criteria 1.7</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Any action that has the potential to alter, damage, or destroy any aspect of original evidence must be performed by qualified persons in a forensically sound manner.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Discussion:</strong> As outlined in the preceding standards and criteria, evidence has value only if it can be shown to be accurate, reliable, and controlled. A quality forensic program consists of properly trained personnel and appropriate equipment, software, and procedures to collectively ensure these attributes.</p></div>
