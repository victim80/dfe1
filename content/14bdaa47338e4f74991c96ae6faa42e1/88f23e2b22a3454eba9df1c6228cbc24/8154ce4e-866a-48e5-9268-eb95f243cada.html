Investigators should comply with the security policies of the organization where the incident has occurred and take actions in accordance with the applicable state and federal laws. Legal compliance ensures that any evidence that is collected and analyzed is admissible in a court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This section discusses some regulations and standards that the forensic investigator must be aware of while performing forensic analysis.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://www.ftc.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Enacted in 1999, Gramm<strong>–</strong>Leach<strong>–</strong>Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions-companies that offer consumers financial products or services such as loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance-to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. The objective of the GLBA is to ease the transfer of financial information between institutions and banks while making the rights of the individual through security requirements more specific.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The provisions of the GLBA limit when a “financial institution” may disclose a consumer’s “non-public personal information” to non-affiliated third parties. The law covers a broad range of financial institutions, including many companies that are not traditionally considered to be financial institutions because they engage in certain “financial activities.” Under the Privacy Rule, only an institution that is “significantly engaged” in financial activities is considered a financial institution.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Financial institutions should notify their customers about their information-sharing practices and tell consumers of their right to “opt-out” if they do not want their information to be shared with certain non-affiliated third parties. Additionally, any entity that receives consumer financial information from a financial institution may be restricted in its reuse and re-disclosure of that information. It helps address incidents of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information maintained by the financial institution in a manner that could result in “substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.”</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://csrc.nist.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">FISMA was introduced as an amendment to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, which was implemented to provide a framework for federal information systems to have more effective information security controls in place. FISMA 2014 made several modifications to the existing articles of FISMA 2002 in order to modernize the security practices followed by federal agencies to address evolving security concerns. These changes resulted in less overall reporting, strengthened the use of continuous monitoring in systems, increased focus on the agencies for compliance, and encouraged reporting that is more focused on the issues caused by security incidents.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">FISMA 2014 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to amend/revise A-130 to eliminate inefficient and wasteful reporting and reflect changes in law and advances in technology. Specific to security and privacy, the updated A-130 emphasizes their roles in the Federal information lifecycle and represents a shift from viewing security and privacy requirements as compliance exercises to crucial elements of a comprehensive, strategic, and continuous risk-based program at federal agencies.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://www.hhs.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates and offers patients an array of rights with respect to such information. The Privacy Rule also permits the disclosure of health information needed for patient care and other important purposes. The HIPAA Security Rule specifies a series of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for covered entities and their business associates to use to assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Office of Civil Rights implemented HIPAA’s Administrative Simplification Statute and Rules, as discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electronic Transaction and Code Sets Standards:&nbsp;</strong>Transactions are electronic exchanges involving the transfer of information between two parties for specific purposes. HIPAA names certain types of organizations as covered entities, including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers. In the HIPAA regulations, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted certain standard transactions for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) of healthcare data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Privacy Rule:&nbsp;</strong>The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and those healthcare providers who conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. The Rule requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal health information and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures of such information without patient authorization. The Rule also gives patients’ rights over their health information, including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records, and to request corrections.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Rule:&nbsp;</strong>The HIPAA Security Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals’ electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or maintained by a covered entity. The Security Rule requires appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employer Identifier Standard:&nbsp;</strong>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires employers to have standard national numbers that identify them on standard transactions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>National Provider Identifier Standard:&nbsp;</strong>The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a HIPAA Administrative Simplification Standard. The NPI is a unique identification number for covered healthcare providers. Covered healthcare providers and all health plans and healthcare clearinghouses must use NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA. The NPI is a ten-position, intelligence-free numeric identifier (ten-digit number). This means that the numbers do not carry other information about healthcare providers, such as the state in which they live or their medical specialty.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enforcement Rule:&nbsp;</strong>The HIPAA Enforcement Rule contains provisions relating to compliance and investigations, the imposition of civil money penalties for violations of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Rules, and procedures for hearings.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>https://www.nist.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The PCI DSS is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM, and POS cards. PCI DSS applies to organizations that “store, process, or transmit cardholder data” for credit cards. One of its requirements is to “track…all access to network resources and cardholder data.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://it.ojp.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Stored Wire Electronic Communications Act are commonly referred together as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986, which comes under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2523. The ECPA updated the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968, which addressed the interception of conversations using “hard” telephone lines but did not apply to the interception of computer and other digital and electronic communications. The ECPA, as amended, protects wire, oral, and electronic communications, while such communications are being made, are in transit, and stored on computers. The Act applies to email, telephone conversations, and data stored electronically.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">ECPA has three titles, which are discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title I:&nbsp;</strong>Often referred to as the Wiretap Act, Title I prohibits the intentional, actual, or attempted interception, use, disclosure, or "procure[ment] [of] any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication." Title I also prohibits the use of illegally obtained communications as evidence.</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><em>Exception:</em> Title I provides exceptions for operators and service providers for uses “in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service" and for "persons authorized by law to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications or to conduct electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978." It provides procedures for federal, State, and other government officers to obtain judicial authorization for intercepting such communications and also regulates the use and disclosure of information obtained through authorized wiretapping.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title II:&nbsp;</strong>Also called the Stored Communications Act (SCA), Title II protects the privacy of the contents of files stored by service providers and of records held about the subscriber by service providers, such as subscriber name, billing records, or IP addresses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title III:&nbsp;</strong>Title III addresses pen register and trap and trace devices and requires government entities to obtain a court order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register (a device that captures the dialed numbers and related information to which outgoing calls or communications are made by the subject) and/or a trap and trace (a device that captures the numbers and related information from which incoming calls and communications coming to the subject have originated).</li></ul><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://gdpr.eu</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The EU GDPR replaced the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy, and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Article 32: Technical and organizational measures need to provide the following:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The pseudonymization and encryption of personal data</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Article 33(1):</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">“In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.”</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Data Protection Act of 2018</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source<strong>:&nbsp;</strong><em>http://www.legislation.gov.uk</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The DPA 2018 sets out the framework for data protection law in the UK. It updates and replaces the Data Protection Act 1998 and came into effect on 25 May 2018. It was amended on 01 January 2021 by regulations under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, to reflect the UK’s status outside the EU.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The DPA is an act to make provision for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals; to make provision in connection with the Information Commissioner’s functions under certain regulations relating to information; to make provision for a direct marketing code of practice; and for connected purposes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The DPA also sets out separate data protection rules for law enforcement authorities, extends data protection to some other areas such as national security and defense, and sets out the Information Commissioner’s functions and powers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Protection of personal data</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The DPA protects individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, in particular by:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Requiring personal data to be processed lawfully and fairly, on the basis of the data subject’s consent or another specified basis,</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Conferring rights on the data subject to obtain information about the processing of personal data and to require inaccurate personal data to be rectified, and</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Conferring functions on the Commissioner, giving the holder of that office responsibility for monitoring, and enforcing their provisions.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">When carrying out functions under the GDPR, the applied GDPR and this Act, the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of securing an appropriate level of protection for personal data, taking account of the interests of data subjects, controllers and others and matters of general public interest.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Source: <em>https://www.sec.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) is an act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2002 to protect investors from the possibility of fraudulent accounting activities by corporations. Although SOX applies primarily to financial and accounting practices, it also encompasses the information technology (IT) functions that support these practices. SOX can be supported by reviewing logs regularly to look for signs of security violations, including exploitation, as well as retaining logs and records of log reviews for future review by auditors.</p></div>
