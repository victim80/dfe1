  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Espionage:</strong> Corporate espionage is a central threat to organizations because competitors often attempt to secure sensitive data through open-source intelligence gathering. Through this approach, competitors can launch similar products in the market, alter prices, and generally undermine the market position of a target organization.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intellectual property theft:&nbsp;</strong>It is the process of stealing trade secrets, copyrights, or patent rights of an asset or a material belonging to individuals or entities. The stolen property is generally handed over to rivals or other competitors, resulting in huge losses to the organization that developed or owned it.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data manipulation:&nbsp;</strong>It is a malicious activity in which attackers modify, change, or alter valuable digital content or sensitive data during transmission, instead of directly stealing the data from the company. Data-manipulation attacks can lead to the loss of trust and integrity.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trojan horse attack:</strong> A computer Trojan is an apparently harmless program or data containing malicious or harmful code, which can later gain control and cause damage such as damage to the file allocation table on the hard disk. Attackers use computer Trojans to trick the victim into performing a predefined action. Trojans are activated upon users’ specific predefined actions such as the unintentional installation of malicious software and clicking on a malicious link. Upon activation, Trojans can grant attackers unrestricted access to all the data stored on the compromised information system, potentially causing severe damage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Structured query language (SQL) attack:</strong> SQL injection/attack is a technique used to take advantage of unsanitized input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web application for execution by a backend database. In this technique, the attacker injects malicious SQL queries into a user input form either to gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Brute-force attack:</strong> It is the process of using a software tool or script to guess the login credentials or keys or discover hidden applications or webpages through a trial-and-error method. A brute-force attack is performed by attempting all possible combinations of usernames and passwords to determine valid credentials.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Phishing/spoofing:</strong> Phishing is a technique in which an attacker sends an email or provides a link falsely claiming to be from a legitimate site to acquire a user’s personal or account information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Privilege escalation attacks:</strong> Privileges are security roles assigned to users of specific programs, features, OSes, functions, files, codes, etc. to limit access based on the user type. If a user is assigned higher privileges, they can modify or interact with more restricted parts of the system or application than less privileged users. Attackers initially gain system access with low privilege and then attempt to gain higher privileges to perform activities restricted from less privileged users.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Denial-of-service (DoS) attack:</strong> A DoS attack is an attack on a computer or network that reduces, restricts, or prevents access to system resources for legitimate users. In a DoS attack, attackers flood a victim’s system with nonlegitimate service requests or traffic to overload its resources and shut down the system, leading to the unavailability of the victim’s website or at least significantly reducing the victim’s system or network performance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cyber defamation:</strong> It an offensive activity wherein a computer or device connected to the web is employed as a tool or source point to damage the reputation of an organization or individual. Sending defamatory emails or posting defamatory statements on social media can damage the reputation of the target organization or entity to a great extent.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cyberterrorism:</strong> It involves the use of the Internet or web resources for threatening, intimidating, or performing violent activities to gain ideological or political advantages over individuals or groups. It can be performed using computer worms, viruses, malicious scripts, or malicious tools with a personal agenda.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cyberwarfare:&nbsp;</strong>Libicki defines cyber warfare as the use of information systems against the virtual personas of individuals or groups. It is the broadest of all types of information warfare. It includes information terrorism, semantic attacks (similar to hacker warfare, but instead of harming a system, it takes over the system while maintaining the perception that it is operating correctly), and simula-warfare (war simulated by, for example, acquiring weapons for mere demonstration rather than actual use).</li></ul></div>
