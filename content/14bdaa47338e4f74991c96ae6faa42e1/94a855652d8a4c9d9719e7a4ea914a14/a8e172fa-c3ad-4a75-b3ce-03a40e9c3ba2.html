Therefore, most of the evidence is present on the devices used by an attacker to connect to a network or the computing devices of the victim. Digital evidence can be any type of file stored on a device including a text file, image, document, executable file, and application data. Most such evidence is located in the storage media of the devices. Based on the storage style and lifespan, digital evidence is categorized into two types: volatile data and non-volatile data.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Volatile data:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to the temporary information on a digital device that requires a constant power supply and is deleted if the power supply is interrupted. For example, the Random-Access Memory stores the most volatile data and discards it when the device is switched off. Important volatile data include system time, logged-on user(s), open files, network information, process information, process-to-port mapping, process memory, clipboard contents, service/driver information, command history, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non-volatile data:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to the permanent data stored on secondary storage devices, such as hard disks and memory cards. Non-volatile data do not depend on the power supply and remain intact even when the device is switched off. Examples include hidden files, slack space, swap file, index.dat files, unallocated clusters, unused partitions, hidden partitions, registry settings, and event logs.</li></ul></div>
