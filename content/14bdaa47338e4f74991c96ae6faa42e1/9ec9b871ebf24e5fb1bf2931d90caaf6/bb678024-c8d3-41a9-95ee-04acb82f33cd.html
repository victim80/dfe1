  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An exponential increase in the number of cybercrimes and civil litigations involving large organizations has emphasized the need for computer forensics. It has become a necessity for organizations to employ the service of a computer forensics agency or to hire a computer forensics expert to solve cases involving the use of computers and related technologies. The staggering financial losses caused by cybercrimes have also contributed to renewed interest in computer forensics.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Computer forensics plays an important role in tracking cybercriminals. The main role of computer forensics is as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure the overall integrity and the continued existence of an organization’s computer system and network infrastructure</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Help the organization capture important information if their computer systems or networks are compromised. Forensic evidence also helps prosecute the perpetrator of a cybercrime, if caught.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Extract, process, and interpret the actual evidence so that it proves the attacker’s actions and their guilt or innocence in court</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Efficiently track down perpetrators/terrorists from different parts of the world. Terrorists who use the Internet as a communication medium can be tracked down, and their plans can be discovered. IP addresses are vital to finding the geographical location of the terrorists.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Save the organization’s money and valuable time. Many managers allocate a large portion of their IT budget for computer and network security.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Track complex cases such as ransomware attacks, email spamming, etc.</li></ul></div>
