  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Cybercrime refers to “any illegal act that involves a computer, its systems, or its applications.” Once investigators start investigating a crime scene, they must remember that cybercrimes are mostly intentional in nature. The type of cybercrime committed depends on the tools of the crime and its target.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The tools of the crime refer to various hacking tools used to commit the crime. They include the computer or workstation used for the crime and the associated software and hardware. When possible, forensic investigators usually take the available tools into custody to use them as evidence.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The target of the crime refers to the victim, which can be a corporate organization, website, consulting agency, or a government body. Targets can also mean a virtual environment that can act as digital evidence because of an incident that occurred on it. A system becomes the target for reasons such as stealing, modifying, or destroying data; unauthorized access; a Denial-of-Service attack; or a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Based on the line of attack, cybercrimes can be classified as internal/insider attacks and external attacks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Internal/Insider attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">These attacks originate from people within the organization such as disgruntled employees, current or terminated employees, business associates, contractors, and/or undertrained staff. These insiders have legitimate access to computer systems and the organization’s data and use such access negatively to harm the organization. As they occur within the organizational network and utilize authorized access, insider attacks can be quite difficult to detect. Examples of internal attacks include espionage, theft of intellectual property, manipulation of records, and Trojan horse attack.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>External attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">External attacks refer to attacks that originate from outside sources. Such attacks occur when the information security policies and procedures are inadequate. Attackers from outside the organization attempt to gain unauthorized access to the organization's computing systems, network, or informational assets. External attacks are often performed by cybercriminals and hackers who target protected corporate information by either exploiting security vulnerabilities or using other social engineering techniques. Examples of external attacks include SQL attack, brute-force cracking, identity theft, phishing/spoofing, denial of service attack, cyber defamation etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Cybercriminals can launch external attacks on any corporate network with various goals and objectives. They might manipulate or destroy confidential information, sabotage systems, steal credentials of trusted users, or demand ransoms. This can severely disrupt business continuity, tarnish the market reputation of the organization, and cause loss of data and financial resources.</p></div>
