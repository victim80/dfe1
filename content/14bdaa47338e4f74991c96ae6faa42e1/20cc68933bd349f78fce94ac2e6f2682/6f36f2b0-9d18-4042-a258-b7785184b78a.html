  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Forensics readiness planning refers to a set of processes to be followed for achieving forensics readiness. The following steps describe the key activities in forensic readiness planning.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Identify the potential evidence required for an incident</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Define the purpose of evidence collection and gather information to determine evidence sources that can help deal with the crime and design the best methods of collection. Produce an evidence requirement statement in collaboration with the people responsible for managing the business risk and those running and monitoring information systems. Possible evidence files include IT audit and device logs, network logs, and system data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Determine the sources of evidence</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Forensic readiness should include knowledge of all the sources of potential evidence present. Determine what currently happens to the potential evidence data and its impact on the business while retrieving the information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Define a policy that determines the pathway to legally extract electronic evidence with minimal disruption</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Devise a strategy to ensure the collection of evidence from all relevant sources and to ensure its preservation in a legally sound manner, while causing minimal disruption to the work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Establish a policy for securely handling and storing the collected evidence</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Secure the collected evidence such that it is available for retrieval in the future. Define a policy for the safe storage and management of potential evidence and define security measures to protect the legitimacy of the data and evidence integrity whenever someone tries to access, use, move, or store additional digital information. In the parlance of investigators, this is the process of continuity of evidence in the United Kingdom and chain of custody in the United States. Document who held and who had access to the evidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Identify if the incident requires full or formal investigation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">There are different types of incidents. Estimate the event and evaluate it to check if it requires a full or formal investigation or can be neglected based on its impact on the business. Escalate an incident only if it has a major impact on business continuity. Be prepared to justify any escalation to a full or formal investigation as escalation consumes resources as well as time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Create a process for documenting the procedure</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A documentation process is necessary for both answering questions and supporting the answers. Documenting the complete process also helps recheck the process if it yields false results.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">It also provides a backup for future reference and will help present the evidence in a court of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Establish a legal advisory board to guide the investigation process</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">All investigation processes should adopt a legal stance, and the organization should seek legal advice before taking any action pertaining to the incident. This is because some incidents may damage the company’s reputation. Form a legal advisory board consisting of experienced personnel who understand the company’s stance and can provide sound advice on the strength of the case and suggest further action.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The legal advisory board will help the organization do the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Manage any threats arising from the incident</li><li style="text-align: justify;">File the incident legally and ensure proper prosecution</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand the legal and regulatory constraints and suggest necessary action</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Handle processes such as reputation protection and public relations issues</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Design legal agreements with partners, customers, investors, and employees</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Investigate the company’s commercial and civil disputes</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keep an incident response team ready to review the incident and preserve the evidence</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Incident management requires a strong and well-qualified team. Organizations need to build a Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) team with members who have the appropriate training for fulfilling their roles.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">It is also necessary to ensure that the members of this team are competent enough to perform any role related to the review of any security incident and preservation of evidence.</p></div>
