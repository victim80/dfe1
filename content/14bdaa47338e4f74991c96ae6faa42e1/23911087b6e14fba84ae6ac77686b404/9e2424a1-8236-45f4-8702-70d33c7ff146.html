  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Most businesses are reliant on the Internet and digital economy today, which has also led to their phenomenal growth on a global scale. However, such complete digitalization of business processes also poses new cybersecurity risks and threats. New methods of cyberattacks and inadequate cybersecurity protocols have resulted in massive data breaches in organizations in recent times. The major consequences of cybercrimes in organizations include theft of sensitive information, disruption of normal business operations, and substantial reputational damage. These breaches further lead to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information stored in organizational systems as well as the loss of customer and stakeholder trust.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The nature of cybercrime is evolving with malicious insider attacks and increased phishing attempts with maximum organizational impact. With the growing number of security breaches, the cost associated with the mitigation of cyberattacks is also rising.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">With such an ever-expanding threat landscape, organizations need to take appropriate measures for the investigation, containment, and eradication of cyber threats. They must also make targeted investments to strengthen their IT security framework in compliance with the relevant policies, standards, and regulations.</p></div>
