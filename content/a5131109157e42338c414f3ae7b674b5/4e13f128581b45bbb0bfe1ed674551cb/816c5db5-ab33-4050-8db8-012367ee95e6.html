  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">MacOS is a Unix-based OS used by Apple in their Macintosh computing systems. The OS depends on Mach and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) kernel layers. The use of Apple products, such as Mac computers, iPods, iPads, and iPhones has increased drastically in the last few years. Over time, they have also become the primary target of cyber-attacks. The increasing number of attacks against Mac systems can be attributed to the advancement of malware tools and lack of sufficient security tools developed to defend these systems from attacks. &nbsp;In order to identify an attack or prove guilt, investigators require evidence such as the presence of malware, unauthorized logging attempts, and connectivity to malicious servers and websites.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Mac forensics refers to the investigation of a crime occurring on or using a MacOS-based device. Mac systems store all such evidence data in log files, directories, configurations, applications history, etc. and investigators need to extract these data and use them to create a timeline to figure out what happened. Therefore, to carry out an effective investigation, investigators should possess in-depth knowledge of the MacOS, its filesystem, libraries, and directories</p></div>
