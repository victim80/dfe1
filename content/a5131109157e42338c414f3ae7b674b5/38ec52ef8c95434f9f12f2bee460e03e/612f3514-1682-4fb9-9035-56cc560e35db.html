  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Memory forensics refers to the examination of volatile data obtained from a system’s memory image file/memory dump. A memory dump (RAM dump) refers to the volatile data captured from a system’s RAM when the system is running. The RAM data contains valuable information pertaining to incidents such as malware attack, system crash, and system compromise. Network security solutions such as firewalls and anti-virus tools cannot detect malicious scripts written to the system RAM. Forensic investigators should perform memory forensics to examine various artifacts and identify malicious activities that occur in a system. Memory forensics also helps to detect and analyze malware residing in the memory that can otherwise go undetected in the hard disk. Forensic analysis of RAM dump provides insights into processes running in the memory, network information, unauthorized access to the system, loaded modules, recently executed commands, injected code fragments, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In a Linux machine, RAM dumps are acquired using specialized tools/software. LiME is one of the most well-known tools used in the acquisition of RAM dumps. In many cybercrime cases, the examination and analysis of memory dumps can lead to the gathering of critical evidence that can be used to identify and prosecute the perpetrators in a court of law. Tools such as Volatility Framework are widely used to perform memory forensics on Linux machines.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Note</strong>: The investigator should procced with the forensic examination based on the information/events recorded by the incident response team.</p></div>
