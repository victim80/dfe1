  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">With respect to the accessibility of content, the web is divided into the following three layers:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Surface Web </strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">As the topmost layer, the surface web stores content that can be accessed as well as indexed by search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Public websites such as Wikipedia, eBay, Facebook, and YouTube can be easily accessed from the surface web. The surface web comprises only 4% of the entire web.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deep Web </strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This layer of the web cannot be accessed by normal users because its contents are not indexed by search engines. The contents of the deep web can be accessed only by a user with due authorization. Information contained in the deep web can include military data, confidential data of organizations, legal dossiers, financial records, medical records, records of governmental departments and subscription information</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dark Web </strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This is the third and the deepest layer of the web. It is an invisible or a hidden part of the web that requires specific web browsers such as the Tor browser to access; such browsers protect the anonymity of the users. It is used to carry out unlawful and antisocial activities. The dark web is not indexed by search engines and allows complete anonymity to its users through encryption. Cyber criminals use the dark web to perform nefarious activities such as drug trafficking, anti-social campaigns, and the use of cryptocurrency for illegal transactions.</p></div>
