  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Tor relay nodes are publicly available in the directory list, but the bridge node is different from relay nodes. Bridge nodes are nodes that are not published or listed in the public directory of Tor nodes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Several entry and exit nodes of the Tor network are publicly listed and accessible on the Internet; consequently, they can be blocked by organizations/governments, if they wish to prohibit the usage of Tor. In many authoritarian countries, governments, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and corporate organizations ban the use of the Tor network. In such scenarios, where the usage of the Tor network is restricted, bridge nodes help circumvent the restrictions and allow users to access the Tor network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The usage of bridge nodes makes it difficult for governments, organizations, and ISPs to censor the usage of the Tor network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>How Bridge Nodes Help Circumvent Restrictions on the Tor Network</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Bridge nodes exist as proxies in the Tor network, and not all of them are publicly listed in the Tor directory of nodes; several bridge nodes are concealed/hidden. Hence, ISPs, organizations, and governments cannot detect their IP addresses or block them. Even if ISPs and organizations detect some of the bridge nodes and censor them, users can simply switch over to other bridge nodes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A Tor user transmits traffic to the bridge node, which transmits it to a guard node as selected by the user. Communication with a remote server occurs normally; however, an extra node of transmission is involved, i.e., the bridge node. The use of concealed bridge nodes as proxies help users circumvent the restrictions placed on the Tor network.</p></div>
