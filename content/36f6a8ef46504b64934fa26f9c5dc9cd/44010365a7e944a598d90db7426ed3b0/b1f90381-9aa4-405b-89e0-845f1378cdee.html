  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">The Tor network has three relays: an entry/guard relay, a middle relay, and an exit relay. These relays are also called nodes or routers and allow network traffic to pass through them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Entry/Guard Relay </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This relay provides an entry point to the Tor network. When attempting to connect via the entry relay, the IP address of the client can be read. The entry relay/guard node transmits the client’s data to the middle node.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Middle Relay </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The middle relay is used for the transmission of data in an encrypted format. It receives the client’s data from the entry relay and passes it to the exit relay.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exit Relay </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As the final relay of the Tor circuit, the exit relay receives the client’s data from the middle relay and sends the data to the destination website’s server. The exit relay’s IP address is directly visible to the destination. Hence, in the event of transmission of malicious traffic, the exit relay is suspected to be the culprit, as it is perceived to be the origin of such malicious traffic. Hence, the exit relay faces the most exposure to legal issues, take-down notices, complaints, etc., even when it is not the origin of malicious traffic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Note:</strong> All the above relays of the Tor network are listed in the public list of Tor relays.</p></div>
