  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Tor browser is based on Mozilla’s Firefox web browser. This browser functions based on the technique of “onion routing,” in which user data is first encrypted with multiple layers that are akin to the layers in an onion; subsequently, the data is sent through the different relays of the Tor network. When user data with multi-layered encryption passes through the different relays of the Tor network, one layer of the encryption over the data is decrypted at each successive relay. When the data reach the last relay in the Tor network, i.e., the exit relay, the final layer of the encryption is removed, after which the data reach the destination server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The destination server perceives the last relay of the Tor network, that is, the exit relay, as the origin of the data. Therefore, in the Tor network, it is extremely difficult to identify the origin of data through any surveillance system. Thus, the Tor browser keeps user data and information about websites and servers safe and anonymous.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The Tor browser provides access to .onion websites available on the dark web. Tor’s hidden service protocol allows users to host websites anonymously with .BIT domains and these websites can only be accessed by users on the Tor network.</p></div>
