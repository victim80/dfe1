  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Non-volatile information can be acquired during static data acquisition. The information obtained from non-volatile data can help investigator retrieve lost/deleted data, browser information, connected devices information, etc., that could be helpful during forensic investigation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Non-volatile data remains unchanged when a system shuts down or loses power. Some examples of non-volatile data include emails, word processing documents, spreadsheets, and various “deleted” files. The investigator can decide what information needs to be extracted from the registry or what information about (or from) files should be collected for additional analysis. There is also a possibility that the attacker could be actively logged into the system and accessing the data. In such cases, the investigator may even decide to track the attacker. &nbsp;It is important that the investigator keeps certain important information intact without any modification or deletion. Once the user starts the system, some data may be modified such as drives mapped to or from the system, services started, or applications installed. These modifications might not be persistent across a reboot and, therefore, the investigator should record and document them.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Non-volatile data usually resides in hard drives; it also exists in swap files, slack space, and unallocated drive space. Other non-volatile data sources include CD-ROMs, USB storage drives, and smart phones.</p></div>
