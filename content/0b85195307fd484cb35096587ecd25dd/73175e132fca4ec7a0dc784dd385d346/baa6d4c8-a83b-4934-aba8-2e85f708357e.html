  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Investigators should extract information about the status of the network interface cards (NICs) that connect a system with the available network. Currently, many laptops and desktops come with built-in wireless NICs, so that information regarding the type of connection a device is using, or the IP address it is using stays hidden. Investigators must gather information about the status of NICs prior to acquiring the system in order to have better insight of the investigation results.</p><p><strong>ipconfig Command</strong></p><p>Source: <em>https://docs.microsoft.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">ipconfig.exe is a command line utility that investigators can use to find out information about NICs and the current TCP/IP configuration. Ipconfig also accepts various Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) commands, thereby allowing a system to update or release its TCP/IP network configuration.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Investigators should use the <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> command to view all the current TCP/IP configuration values including the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and WINS and DNS configuration. The information generated by this command also includes the state of the NIC and DHCP. Collecting this information will help investigators examine the network traffic logs and the IP address of the systems involved in a security incident.</p></div>
