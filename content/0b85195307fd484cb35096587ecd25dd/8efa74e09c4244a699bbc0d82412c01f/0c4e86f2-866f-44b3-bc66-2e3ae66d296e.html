  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Volatile information can be acquired during live data acquisition. The information obtained from volatile data can help forensic investigator perform malware analysis, examine log files and cache files, determine passwords, etc. All these can serve as a potential source of evidence during forensic investigation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As mentioned earlier, volatile information refers to the data stored in the registries, cache, and RAM of digital devices. This information is usually lost or erased whenever the system is turned off or rebooted. Volatile information is dynamic in nature and changes with time; so, investigators should be able to collect the data in real-time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Volatile data exists in physical memory or RAM and consists of process information, process-to-port mapping, process memory, network connections, clipboard contents, state of the system, etc. Investigators must collect this data during the live data acquisition process. Additionally, they should follow the Locardâ€™s Exchange Principle and collect the contents of the RAM right at the beginning of the investigation to minimize the impact of further steps on the integrity of the contents of the RAM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investigators need to be well aware of the fact that the tools they are running to collect other volatile information can modify the contents of the memory. Based on the collected volatile information, investigators can determine the user(s) logged-on, timeline of a security incident, programs and libraries involved, files accessed and shared during a suspected attack, as well as other details such as network information, network connections, network status, open files, process-to-port mapping, mapped drives, command history, process information, process memory, shares, clipboard contents, etc.</p></div>
