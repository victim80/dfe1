  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Prefetch files store information on applications that have been run on the system. The prefetch files can serve as a valuable source of forensic evidence for investigators because even if applications that were run on a system are later deleted or uninstalled, the prefetch files pertaining to those applications still reside in the prefetch folder at <strong>C:\Windows\Prefetch</strong>.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">DWORD value at the offset 144 within the file corresponds to the number of times the application is launched. DWORD value at the offset 120 within the file corresponds to the last time of the application run, this value is stored in UTC format. Information from .pf file can be correlated with the registry or Event Log information to determine who was logged on to the system, who was running which applications, etc.</p><p><strong>Prefetching</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Prefetching is used by the Windows OS to speed up system boot process<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and application launches. The data is recorded for up to first 10 seconds after the application process is started. Once the data is processed, it is written to a .pf file in the <strong>Windows\Prefetch</strong> directory. The forensic investigator should identify whether the victimâ€™s system has enabled the prefetching process, before conducting examination. Prefetching is controlled by the registry key:</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet00x\Control\SessionManager\MemoryManagement\PrefetchParameters</strong>.</p></div>
