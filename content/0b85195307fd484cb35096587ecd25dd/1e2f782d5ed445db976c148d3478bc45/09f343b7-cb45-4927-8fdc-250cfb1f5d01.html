  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The first step while investigating an incident is the collection of the system time. System time refers to the exact date and time of the day when an incident happened, as per coordinated universal time (UTC). System time provides applications with accurate time and date. The knowledge of system time provides a great deal of context to the information collected in the subsequent steps. It also assists in reconstructing the events that occurred on the system. Apart from the current system time, information regarding the system uptime provides great deal of assistance to the whole investigation process.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Investigators also record the real time, or wall time, when recording the system time. Comparing both the timings allows the investigator to further determine whether the system clock was accurate or inaccurate. Investigators can extract system time and date with the help of the <strong>date /t</strong><strong>&nbsp;&amp; time /t</strong> command or use the <strong>net statistics server</strong> command. An alternative way to obtain the system time details is by using the GetSystemTime function. This function copies the time details to a SYSTEMTIME structure, which contains information of the logged-in members and the exact month, day, year, weekday, hour, minute, seconds, and milliseconds. Hence, this function provides more accurate system time details.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Command:</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>date /t</strong><strong>&nbsp;&amp; time /t</strong></p></div>
