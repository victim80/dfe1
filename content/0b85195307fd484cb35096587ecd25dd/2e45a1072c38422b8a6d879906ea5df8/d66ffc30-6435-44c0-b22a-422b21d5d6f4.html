  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Slack space, also called file slack, refers to the portions of a hard drive that may contain data either from a previously deleted file or unused space by the currently allocated file. It is the space generated between the end of a stored file and the end of the disk cluster. This happens when the size of the file currently written is less than that of the previous written file on the same cluster. In such cases, the residual data remains as it is, and may contain meaningful information when examined forensically. Non-contiguous file allocation leaves more trailing clusters leaving more slack space. The data residue in the slack space is retrieved by reading the complete cluster.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It may be possible to use slack space to store data that one wants to hide without having knowledge of the underlying file system. To do so, make a file smaller than the slack space present and use the rest of space to store the hidden data. This data will be invisible to the file system and remains the same until changed manually. However, creating new files that result in slack space is not the safest way to hide data. DriveSpy tool collects all the slack space in an entire partition into a file.</p></div>
