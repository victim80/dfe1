Investigators should use tools such as Process Explorer to check if the process is malicious/suspicious. The tool comes with built-in VirusTotal support to check whether the running process is malicious.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the tools that can help investigators examine running processes are briefly discussed below.</p><p><strong>Process Explorer</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://docs.microsoft.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Process Explorer shows information about the handles and DLLs of the processes that have been opened or loaded.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Process Explorer display consists of two sub-windows. The top window always shows a list of currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode of the Process Explorer.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If it is in handle mode, handles that are opened by the process selected in the top window are shown.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If Process Explorer is in DLL mode, DLLs and memory-mapped files that the selected process has loaded are shown. &nbsp;</p></div>
