In the registry, data is stored in folders in tree-like structures, which are referred to as hives.</p>The main registry hives are:</div><ul><li>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</li><li>HKEY_USERS</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">With respect to data persistence, Windows Registry hives are divided into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-volatile:</strong> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS</li><li><strong>Volatile:&nbsp;</strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The volatile hives are captured during live analysis of the system, while non-volatile hives are stored on the hard drive. Hives perform a key role in the functioning of the system.</p><p>The main registry hives are listed below:</p><p><strong>HKEY_USERS&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">HKEY_USERS, abbreviated as HKU, contains information about all the currently active user profiles on the computer. Each registry key under HKEY_USERS hive relates to a user on the computer, which is named after the user security identifier (SID). The registry keys and registry values under each SID control the user specific mapped drives, installed printers, environmental variables, and so on.</p><p><strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, abbreviated as HKCR, is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software. It contains file extension association information and programmatic identifier (ProgID), Class ID (CLSID), and Interface ID (IID) data. This hive stores the necessary information that makes sure that the correct program opens when the user opens a file through Windows Explorer. The class registration and file name extension information stored under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is found under both â€“ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE as well as HKEY_CURRENT_USER.</p><p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, abbreviated as HKCC, stores information about the current hardware profile of the system. The information stored under this hive explains the differences between the current hardware configuration and the standard configuration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG is simply a pointer to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current registry key, which contains information about the standard hardware configuration that is stored under the Software and System keys.</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, abbreviated as HKLM, contains most of the configuration information for installed software (which includes Windows OS as well) and information about the physical state of the computer (which includes bus type, installed cards, memory type, startup control parameters, and device drives).</p><p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">HKEY_CURRENT_USER, abbreviated as HKCU, contains the configuration information related to the user currently logged-on. This hive controls the user-level settings associated with user profile such as desktop wallpaper, screen colors, display settings, etc.</p></div>
