For example, the investigator might have quickly identified processes of interest that required no additional extensive investigation. There are ways to collect all the memory used by a processâ€”not just what is present in physical memory but what is in virtual memory or the page file as well. The Process Dumper tool dumps the entire process space, along with additional metadata and the process environment, to the console (STDOUT) so that the output can be redirected to a file or a socket.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Userdump.exe allows dumping of any process, without attaching a debugger and without terminating the process once the dump has been completed. Moreover, the dump file generated by userdump.exe can be read by MS debugging tools. However, it requires installation of its specific driver. Another method of dumping a process is to use adplus.vbs script. Once done with the dumping process, investigators can use debugging tools such as Handle.exe and ListDLLs.exe to analyze the dump files.</p></div>
