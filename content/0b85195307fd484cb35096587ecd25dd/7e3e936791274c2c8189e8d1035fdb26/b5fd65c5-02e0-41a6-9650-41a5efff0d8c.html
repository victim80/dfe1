It includes value indicating the type of the restore point; a descriptive name for the restore point creation event, and the 64-bit FILETIME object indicating when the restore point was created. Description of the restore point can be useful for information regarding the installation or removal of an application. System restore points are created when applications and unsigned drivers are installed, when an auto update installation and a restore operation are performed. Description of the event that caused the restore point creation is written to the rp.log file, and this log file helps the investigator to notice the date when the application was installed or removed</p></div>
