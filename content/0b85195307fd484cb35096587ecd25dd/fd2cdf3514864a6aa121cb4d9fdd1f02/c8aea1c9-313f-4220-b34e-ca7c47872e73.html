  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Key system and application files are continuously monitored to restore the system to a particular state. File changes are recorded in the change.log files, which are located in the restore point directories. Changes to the monitored files are detected by the restore point file system driver, the original filename is entered into the change.log file along with sequence number, type of change occurred, etc. Monitored file is preserved and copied to the restore point directory and renamed in the format Axxxxxxx.ext, where x represents a sequence number and .ext is the fileâ€™s original extension. First change.log file is appended with a sequence number and a new change.log file is created when the system is restarted.</p></div>
