The system also creates a memory dump when it does not have enough memory for system operation. Crash dumps help in diagnosing and identifying bugs in a program that led to the system crash. It includes all the information regarding stop messages, a list of loaded drivers, and information about the processor that stopped. The information in memory dumps is in binary, octal, or hexadecimal format. This backup enables users to examine the cause of the system crash and identify any errors in the applications or in the OS. In Windows systems, it is popularly known as the blue screen of death (BSOD). The core dump includes the system state, memory locations, application or program status, program counters, etc. before the system failure. The system needs to reboot to be accessible after the memory dump is taken. This memory also maintains a system log file for future reference.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In Windows 10, the OS creates the following memory dumps:</p></div><div class="WordSection2"><ul><li>Automatic memory dump</li><li>Complete memory dump</li><li>Kernel memory dump</li><li>Small memory dump</li></ul></div><p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the crash dumps can sometimes help a forensic investigator in finding out if the crash is caused due to an internal error or by a remote attacker, who was successful in exploiting a bug in the OS, or a third-party application installed on the OS. Investigators can use tools such as DumpChk to analyze the memory dump in such cases.</p></div>
