  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">While acquiring a bit-by-bit copy of the evidence in a system might seem ideal, this may require a significant amount of time for large disks. In situations with time and resource constraints, two other primary types of data acquisition, namely logical acquisition and sparse acquisition, may be more suitable.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Logical Acquisition</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In a situation with time constraints and where the investigator is aware of what files need to be acquired, logical acquisition may be considered ideal. Logical acquisition gathers only the files required for the case investigation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">For example:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Collection of Outlook .pst or .ost files in email investigations</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Specific record collection from a large RAID server</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sparse Acquisition</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Sparse acquisition is similar to logical acquisition. Through this method, investigators can collect fragments of unallocated (deleted) data. This method is useful when it is not necessary to inspect the entire drive.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bit-Stream Imaging</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A bit-stream image is a bit-by-bit copy of any storage media that contains a cloned copy of the entire media, including all its sectors and clusters. This cloned copy of the storage media contains all the latent data that enables investigators to retrieve deleted files and folders. Investigators often use bit-stream images of the suspect media to prevent contamination of the original media. Moreover, most computer forensic tools such as FTK Imager and EnCase, can read bit-stream images, which further facilitates the investigation process. There are two kinds of bit-stream imaging procedures â€” bitstream disk-to-image-file and bit-stream disk-to-disk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bit-stream disk-to-image-file</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Forensic investigators commonly use this data acquisition method. It is a flexible method that enables the creation of one or more copies of the suspect drive. Tools such as ProDiscover, EnCase, FTK, The Sleuth Kit, X-Ways Forensics, etc., can be used to create image files.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bit-stream disk-to-disk</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators cannot create a bit-stream disk-to-image file in the following situations:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The suspect drive is very old and incompatible with the imaging software</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There is a need to recover credentials used for websites and user accounts</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In such cases, a bit-stream disk-to-disk copy of the original disk or drive can be performed. While creating a disk-to-disk copy, the geometry of the target disk, including its head, cylinder, and track configuration, can be modified to align with the suspect drive. This results in a smooth data acquisition process. Tools like EnCase, SafeBack, and Tableau Forensic Imager can help create a disk-to-disk bit-stream copy of the suspect drive.</p></div>
