  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;height:normal;">Figure 4.2: Determine data acquisition method</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following are some key factors that must be considered in determining the data acquisition method.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Size of the suspect drive</strong>: If the suspect drive is large in size, the investigator must opt for disk-to-image copying. Further, if the size of the target disk is significantly smaller than that of the suspect drive, investigators need to adopt methods to reduce the data size such as the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Using Microsoft disk compression tools such as DriveSpace and DoubleSpace, which exclude slack disk space between the files.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Using compression methods that use an algorithm to reduce the file size. Archiving tools like PKZip, WinZip, and WinRAR can help to compress files.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Testing lossless compression by applying an MD5, SHA-2, or SHA- 3 hash on a file before and after compression. The compression is successful only if the hash values match.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In some cases, when the suspect drive is too large, forensic investigators can utilize the following techniques:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Use tape backup systems like Super Digital Linear Tape (SDLT) or Digital Audio Tape/Digital Data Storage (DAT/DDS)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Use SnapBack and SafeBack, which have software drivers to write data to a tape backup system from a suspect drive through the standard PCI/SCSI</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Time required to acquire the image</strong>: The time required for data acquisition increases with increasing sizes of the suspect drives. For example, a suspect drive of 1 TB might require over 11 hours for the completion of the data acquisition process. In such cases, investigators need to prioritize and acquire only those data that are of evidentiary value. By acquiring only those data that are required for investigation, investigators can reduce both time and effort.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Whether the suspect drive can be retained</strong>:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">If the investigator cannot retain the original drive, as in a discovery demand for a civil litigation case, they should check whether logical acquisition is acceptable in court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the investigators can retain the drive, they must create a copy of it using a reliable data acquisition tool, as most discovery demands provide only one opportunity to capture data.</li></ul></div>
