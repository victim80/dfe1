It is the use of established methods to extract Electronically Stored Information (ESI) from suspect computer or storage media to gain insight into a crime or an incident. With the progress of technology, the process of data acquisition is becoming increasingly accurate, simple, and versatile. However, investigators need to ensure that the acquisition methodology used is forensically sound. Specifically, the acquisition methodology adopted must be verifiable and repeatable. This enhances the admissibility of the acquired data or evidence in the court of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A fundamental factor to consider in the acquisition of forensic data is time. While data in some sources such hard drives remain unaltered and can be collected even after the system is shut down, data in some sources such as the RAM are highly volatile and dynamic and must therefore be collected in real-time. From this perspective, data acquisition can be either categorized as live data acquisition or dead data acquisition.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In live data acquisition, data is acquired from a computer that is already powered on (either locked or in sleep mode). This enables the collection of volatile data that are fragile and lost when the system loses power or is switched off. Such data reside in registries, caches, and RAM. Further, volatile data such as that in RAM are dynamic and change rapidly, and therefore must be collected in real-time. In dead or static data acquisition, nonvolatile data that remains unaltered in the system even after shutdown is collected. Investigators can recover such data from hard drives as well as from slack space, swap files, and unallocated drive space. Other sources of non-volatile data include CD-ROMs, USB thumb drives, smartphones, and PDAs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">We next delve into further details of these two categories of data acquisition along with the sources of data that they capture.</p></div>
