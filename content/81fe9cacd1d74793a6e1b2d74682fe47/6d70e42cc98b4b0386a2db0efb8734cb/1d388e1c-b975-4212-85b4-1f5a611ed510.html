  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Before data acquisition and duplication, an appropriate data sanitization method must be used to permanently erase any previous information stored on the target media. Destruction of data using industry standard data destruction methods is essential for sensitive data that one does not want falling into the wrong hands. These standards depend on the levels of sensitivity. Data deletion and disposal on electronic devices is only virtual, but physically it remains, posing a security threat.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Methods like hard drive formatting or deleting partitions cannot delete the file data completely. However, it is important to destroy the data and protect it from retrieval, after the collection of evidence from the computer. Therefore, the only way to erase the data completely and protect it from recovery is to overwrite the data by applying a code of sequential zeroes or ones.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Further, once the target data is collected and analyzed, the media must be appropriately disposed to prevent data retrieval and protect its confidentiality.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators can follow different standards as given below while sanitizing the target media:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Russian Standard, GOST P50739-95 (6 passes):</strong> It is a wiping method that writes zeros in the first pass and then random bytes in the next pass</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>(German) VSITR (7 passes):</strong> This method overwrites in 6 passes with alternate sequences of 0x00 and 0xFF, and with 00xAA in the last (7<sup>th</sup>) pass</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>(American) NAVSO P-5239-26 (MFM) (3 passes):</strong> This is a three-pass overwriting algorithm that verifies in the last pass</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>(American) DoD 5220.22-M (7 passes):</strong> This standard destroys the data on the driveâ€™s required area by overwriting with 010101 in the first pass, 101010 in the second pass and repeating this process thrice. This method then overwrites that area with random characters which is the 7<sup>th</sup> pass.</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>(American) NAVSO P-5239-26 (RLL) (3 passes):</strong> This is a three-pass overwriting algorithm that verifies in the last pass</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>NIST SP 800-88:&nbsp;</strong>The proposed NIST SP 800-88 guidance explains three sanitization methods-</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Clear</strong>: Logical techniques applied to sanitize data in all storage areas using the standard read and write commands</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Purge</strong>: Involves physical or logical techniques to make the target data recovery infeasible by using state-of-the-art laboratory techniques</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Destroy</strong>: Enables target data recovery to be infeasible with the use of state-of-the-art laboratory techniques, which result in an inability to use the media for data storage</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The National Institute of Standards and Technology has issued a set of guidelines as given below to help organizations sanitize data to preserve the confidentiality of the information.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The application of complex access controls and encryption can reduce the chances for an attacker to gain direct access to sensitive information</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An organization can dispose of the not so useful media data by internal or external transfer or by recycling to fulfill data sanitization</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Effective sanitization techniques and tracking of storage media are crucial to ensure protection of sensitive data by organizations against attackers</li><li style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">All organizations and intermediaries are responsible for effective information management and data sanitization</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Physical destruction of media involves techniques, such as cross-cut shredding. Departments can destroy media on-site or through a third party that meets confidentiality standards. Investigators must consider the type of target media they are using for copying or duplicating the data and select an appropriate sanitization method to ensure that no part of previous data remains on the target media that will store the evidence files. The previous media may alter the properties or changes the data and its structure.</p></div>
