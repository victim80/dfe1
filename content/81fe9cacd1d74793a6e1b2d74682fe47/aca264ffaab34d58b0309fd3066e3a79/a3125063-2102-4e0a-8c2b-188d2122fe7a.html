  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An important aspect of computer forensics is the validation of digital evidence. This is essential to verify the integrity of the data. Validating data acquisition involves calculating the hash value of the target media and comparing it with its forensic counterpart to ensure that the data has been completely acquired.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The unique number (hash value) is referred to as a digital fingerprint, which represents the uniqueness of a file or disk drive. When two files have the same hash values, they are considered identical, even if they have different filenames, as the hash values are generated based on their actual content. Even a slight modification in the content of a file changes its hash value completely. Further, a hash is a one-way function, which implies that decryption is impossible without a key.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The following are some hashing algorithms that can be used to validate the data acquired:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CRC-32</strong>: Cyclic redundancy code algorithm-32 is a hash function based on the idea of polynomial division. The number 32 indicates that the size of the resulting hash value or checksum is 32 bits. The checksum identifies errors after data transmission or storage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MD5</strong>: This is an algorithm used to check data integrity by creating a 128-bit message digest from data input of any length. Every MD5 hash value is unique to that particular data input.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHA-1</strong>: Secure Hash Algorithm-1 is a cryptographic hash function developed by the United States National Security Agency, and it is a US Federal Information Processing Standard issued by NIST. It creates a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value called a message digest. This hash value is a 40 digits long hexadecimal number.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SHA-256</strong>: This is a cryptographic hash algorithm that creates a unique and fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash. Therefore, it is ideal for anti-tamper technologies, password validation, digital signatures, and challenge hash authentication.</li></ul></div>
