Working on a live system may alter the contents of the RAM or processes running on the system. Any involuntary action may change file access dates and times, use shared libraries or DLLs, trigger the execution of malware, or —in the worst case — force a reboot, thus making the system inaccessible. Therefore, the examination of a live system and volatile data acquisition must be conducted carefully. While most volatile data are recovered by examining the live system, approximately the same amount of data can be obtained by examining the image acquired from the memory of the system. The following sections describe how to acquire volatile data from Windows, Linux, and Mac systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acquire Volatile Data from a Windows Machine</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Forensic tools such as Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer can be used to extract the entire contents of the computer’s volatile memory.
