  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The live data acquisition process involves the collection of volatile data from devices when they are live or powered on. Volatile information, as present in the contents of RAM, cache, DLLs, etc. is dynamic, and is likely to be lost if the device to be investigated is turned off. It must therefore be acquired in real time. Examination of volatile information assists in determining the logical timeline of a security incident and the users that are likely to be responsible for it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Live acquisition can then be followed by static/dead acquisition, where the investigator shuts down the suspect machine, removes the hard disk, and then acquires its forensic image.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Live data acquisition can help investigators obtain information even if the data of evidentiary value is stored on the cloud using a service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Investigators can also acquire data from unencrypted containers or disks that are open on the system and are automatically encrypted when the system shuts down. If the suspect has attempted to overwrite data on the physical hard disk to avoid detection, there is a possibility that investigators can find traces of such overwritten data by examining the RAM content.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Depending on the source from which they are obtained, volatile data are of two types:</p><p><strong>System data</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">System information is the information related to a system, which can serve as evidence in a security incident. This information includes the current configuration and running state of the suspect computer. Volatile system information includes system profile (details about configuration), login activity, current system date and time, command history, current system uptime, running processes, open files, startup files, clipboard data, users logged in, DLLs, and shared libraries. The system information also includes critical data stored in the slack spaces of the hard disk drive.</p><p><strong>Network data</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Network information is the network-related information stored in the suspect system and connected network devices. Volatile network information includes open connections and ports, routing information and configuration, ARP cache, shared files, and services accessed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Apart from the above data, live acquisition can help investigators obtain the following.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Data from unencrypted containers or disks that are open on the system, which are automatically encrypted when the system shuts down</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Private browsing history and data from remote storage services such as Dropbox (cloud service) by examining the random-access memory (RAM)</li></ul></div>
