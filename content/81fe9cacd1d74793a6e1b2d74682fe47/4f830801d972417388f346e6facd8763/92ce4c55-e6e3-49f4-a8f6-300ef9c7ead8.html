  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Raw Format</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Raw format creates a bit-by-bit copy of the suspect drive. Images in this format are usually obtained by using the <strong>dd</strong> command.</p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="height:normal;">Fast data transfers</li><li style="height:normal;">Minor data read errors on source drive are ignored</li><li style="height:normal;">Read by most of the forensic tools</li></ul><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li style="height:normal;">Requires same amount of storage as that of the original media</li><li style="height:normal;">Tools (mostly open source) might fail to recognize/collect marginal (bad) sectors from the suspect drive</li></ul><p>Freeware tools have a low threshold of retry reads on weak media spots on a drive, whereas commercial acquisition tools use more retries to ensure all data is collected</p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Proprietary Format</strong></p><p style="height:normal;">Commercial forensics tools acquire data from the suspect drive and save the image files in their own formats. They offer certain features which include the following:</p><ul><li style="height:normal;">Option to compress the image files of the evidence disk/drive in order to save space on the target media</li><li style="height:normal;">Ability to split an image into multiple segments, in order to save them to smaller target media such as CD/DVD, while maintaining their integrity</li><li style="height:normal;">Ability to incorporate metadata into the image file, which includes date and time of acquisition, hash values of the files, case details, etc.</li></ul><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li style="height:normal;">Image file format created by one tool may not be supported by other tool(s)</li></ul><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Advanced Forensics Format (AFF)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">AFF is an open-source data acquisition format that stores disk images and related metadata. The objective behind the development of the format was to create an open disk imaging format that provides users an alternative to being locked into a proprietary format.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The AFF file extensions are .afm for the AFF metadata and .afd for segmented image files. There are no implementation restrictions imposed by AFF on forensic investigators, as it is an open-source format.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">AFF has simple design and is accessible through multiple computing platforms and OSes. It provides option to compress the image files and allocates space to record metadata of the image files or segmented files. It provides internal consistency checks for self-authentication.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">AFF supports the following two compression algorithms:</p><ul><li>Zlib, which is faster but less efficient</li><li>LZMA, which is slower but more efficient</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The actual disk image in AFF is a single file, which is composed of segments with drive data and metadata. AFF file contents can be compressed and uncompressed. AFFv3 supports AFF, AFD, and AFM file extensions.</p><p style="height:normal;"><strong>Advanced Forensic Framework 4 (AFF4)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Michael Cohen, Simson Garfinkel, and Bradly Schatz created the Advanced Forensic Framework 4 (AFF4) as a redesigned and revamped version of the AFF format, which is designed to support storage media with large capacities. The creators referred to its design as being object-oriented as the format consists of generic objects (volumes, streams, and graphs) with externally accessible behavior. These objects can be addressed by their name within the AFF4 universe. They are universally referenced through a unique URL. It is an abstract information model that allows storage of disk-image data in one or more places while the information about the data is stored elsewhere. It stores more kinds of organized information in the evidence file. It offers unified data model and naming scheme.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The format can support a vast number of images and offers a selection of container formats such as Zip and Zip64 for the binary files, and simple directories. It also supports storage from the network and the use of WebDAV (an extension of the HTTP protocol) that enables imaging directly to a central HTTP server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This format supports also maps, which are zero-copy transformations of data. Zero-copy transformations spare the CPU from having to perform the task of copying data from one memory area to another, thus increasing its efficiency.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">For example, without storing a new copy of a carved file (the file being extracted), only a map of the blocks allocated to this file can be stored. AFF4 supports image signing and cryptography. This format also offers image transparency to clients.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The AFF4 design adopts a scheme of globally unique identifiers for identifying and referring to all evidence. Basic AFF4 object types include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Volumes</strong>: They store segments, which are indivisible blocks of data</li><li><strong>Streams</strong>: These are data objects that can help in reading or writing, for example, segments, images, and maps</li><li><strong>Graphs</strong>: Collections of RDF statements</li></ul></div>
