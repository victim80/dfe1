  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">While performing live data acquisition, investigators need to collect data while considering their potential volatility and the impact of the collection on the suspect system. As not all data have the same level of volatility, investigators must collect the most volatile data first, and then proceed to the collection of the least volatile data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The order of volatility for a typical computing system as per the RFC 3227 Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving is as follows:</p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Registers, processor cache</strong>: The information in the registers or the processor cache on the computer exists for nanoseconds. It is constantly changing and can be classified as the most volatile data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Routing table, process table, kernel statistics, and memory</strong>: The routing table, ARP cache, and kernel statistics reside in the ordinary memory of the computer. These are slightly less volatile than the information in the registers, with a life span of about ten nanoseconds.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Temporary system files</strong>: Temporary system files tend to persist for a longer time on the computer compared to routing tables and ARP caches. These systems are eventually overwritten or changed, sometimes in seconds or minutes later.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk or other storage media</strong>: Anything stored on a disk stays for a while. However, sometimes due to unforeseen events, these data can be erased or overwritten. Therefore, disk data may also be considered somewhat volatile, with a lifespan of some minutes.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Remote logging and monitoring data related to the target system</strong>: Data that pass through a firewall cause a router or switch to generate logs. The system might store these logs elsewhere. These logs may overwrite themselves within an hour, a day, or a week. However, these are generally less volatile data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical configuration and network topology</strong>: Physical configuration and network topology are less volatile and have a longer life span than some other logs</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Archival media</strong>: A DVD-ROM, a CD-ROM, or a tape contains the least volatile data because the digital information does not change in such data sources automatically unless damaged under a physical force</li></ol></div>
