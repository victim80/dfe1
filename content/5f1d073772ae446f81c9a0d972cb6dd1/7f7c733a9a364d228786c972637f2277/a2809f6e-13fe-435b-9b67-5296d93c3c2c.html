Recycle Bin cannot store items larger than its storage capacity. When a user deletes a file or folder, Windows stores all the details of the file, such as its name and the path where it was stored, in INFO2, which is a hidden file found in Recycle Bin. The OS uses this information to restore the deleted file to its original location. The Recycled hidden folder contains files deleted from a Windows machine.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>In earlier versions of Windows, the deleted files were renamed by the OS using the following format:</strong></p><p><strong>D&lt;original drive letter of file&gt;&lt;#&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">For example, in the case of a Dxy.ext file in the Recycled folder, “x” denotes the name of drive such as “C,” “D,” and others; “y” denotes the sequential number starting from one; and “ext” is the extension of the original file.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>In Windows Vista and later versions, the deleted files are renamed by the OS using the following format:</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>$R&lt;#&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;</strong>, where <strong>&lt;#&gt;&nbsp;</strong>represents a set of random letters and numbers</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">At the same time, a corresponding metadata file is created which is named as:</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">$<strong>I&lt;#&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;</strong>, where <strong>&lt;#&gt;&nbsp;</strong>represents a set of random letters and numbers the same as used for <strong>$R</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The <strong>$R</strong> and <strong>$I</strong> files are located at <strong>C:\$Recycle.Bin\&lt;USER SID&gt;\</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>$I file contains following metadata:</strong></p><ul><li>Original file name</li><li>Original file size</li><li>The date and time the file was delete</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In Windows versions newer than Vista and XP, the OS stores the complete path and file or folder name in a hidden file called INFO2. This file remains inside the Recycled or Recycler folder and stores information about the deleted files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">INFO2 is the master database file and is very crucial for the recovery of data. It contains various details of deleted files such as their original file name, original file size, date and time of deletion, unique identifying number, and the drive number in which the file was stored.</p></div>
