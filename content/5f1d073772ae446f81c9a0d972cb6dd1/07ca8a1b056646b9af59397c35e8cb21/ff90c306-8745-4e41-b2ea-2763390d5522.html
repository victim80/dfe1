  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Passwords are important because they are the gateway to most computer systems. Password protection shields information, protects networks, applications, files, documents, etc. from unauthorized users. Many organizations and individuals, who do not want others to access their data, resources, and other products, employ passwords and strong cryptographic algorithms as security measures.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers and intruders use these protection techniques to hide evidence data, prevent reverse engineering of applications, hinder information extraction from network devices, and prevent access to system and hard disk. This can make forensic investigatorsâ€™ work difficult. Encryption is a preferred technique for deterring forensic analysis. In such cases, investigators can use password cracking tools such as ophcrack and RainbowCrack to circumvent the password protection.</p></div>
