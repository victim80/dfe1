  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When any user deletes a file, the OS does not actually delete the file but marks the file entry as unallocated in the Master File Table (MFT) and allocates a special character. This character denotes that the space is now ready for use.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In FAT file system, the OS replaces the first letter of a deleted file name with a hex byte code, E5h. E5h is a special tag that indicates a deleted file. The FAT file system marks the corresponding clusters of that file as unused, although they are not empty.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In NTFS file system, when a user deletes a file, the OS just marks the file entry as unallocated but does not delete the actual file contents. The clusters allocated to the deleted file are marked as free in the $BitMap ($BitMap file is a record of all used and unused clusters). The computer now notices those empty clusters and avails that space for storing a new file. The deleted file can be recovered if the space is not allocated to any other file. On a Windows system, performing normal Delete operation sends the files to the Recycle Bin. Whereas performing the Shift+Delete operation bypasses the Recycle Bin.</p></div>
