  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">When a file is deleted from the hard drive, the pointer to the file is removed by the OS and the sectors containing the deleted data are marked as available, which means the contents of the deleted data remain on the hard disk until they are overwritten by new data. Forensic investigators use data recovery tools such as Autopsy, Recover My Files, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro, R-Studio, etc., to scan the hard drive and analyze the file system for successful data recovery.</p></div>
