  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">File carving refers to a technique that is used to recover deleted/lost files and fragments of files from the hard disk when file system metadata is missing. By allowing forensic investigators to retrieve files that have been deleted/lost from a hard disk, file carving helps extract valuable artifacts related to a case of cyber-crime for further examination. A perpetrator may also attempt to delete an entire partition from the hard disk and then merge the deleted partition’s unallocated space with the system’s primary partition to prevent an investigator from identifying the lost partition.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">As discussed before, file carving is the process of recovering files from their fragments and pieces from unallocated space of the hard disk in the absence of file system metadata. In computer forensics, it helps investigators extract data from a storage medium without any support from the file system used in the creation of the file.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Unallocated space refers to the hard disk space that does not contain any file information but stores file data without the details of its location. Investigators can identify the files using certain characteristics such as file header (the first few bytes) and footer (the last few bytes).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For example, a suspect may try to hide an image from detection by investigators by changing the file extension from .jpg to .dll. However, changing the file extension does not change the file header, which can reveal the actual file format. A file format is confirmed as .jpg if it shows “JFIF” in the file header and hex signature as “4A 46 49 46“.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">File carving methods may vary based on different elements such as the fragments of data present, deletion technique used, type of storage media, etc. This process depends on information about the format of the existing files of interest. Investigators can analyze the file headers to verify the file format using tools such as 010 Editor, CI Hex Viewer, Hexinator, Hex Editor Neo, Qiew, WinHex, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">File carving does not require file system structure to recover data from the disk whereas file recovery requires knowledge of the file system structure to recover deleted data.</li></ul></div>
