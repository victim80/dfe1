  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">There are three popular techniques for password cracking and they are discussed below:</p><p><strong>Dictionary Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In a dictionary attack, a dictionary file is loaded into the cracking application that runs against user accounts. A dictionary is a text file that contains several dictionary words or predetermined character combinations. The program uses every word present in the dictionary to find the password. Dictionary attacks are more useful than a brute-force attack. However, this attack does not work against a system that uses passphrases or passwords not contained within the dictionary used.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This attack is applicable in two situations:</p><ul><li>In cryptanalysis, it helps find out the decryption key for obtaining the plaintext from the ciphertext</li><li>In computer security, it helps avoid authentication and access to a computer by guessing passwords</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Methods to improve the success of a dictionary attack:</p><ul><li>Using more number of dictionaries, such as technical dictionaries and foreign dictionaries, can help retrieve the correct password</li><li>Using string manipulation; for example, if the dictionary contains the word, “system,” then try string manipulation and use “metsys” and others</li></ul><p><strong>Brute-Forcing Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Cryptographic algorithms must be hard enough to prevent a brute-force attack. RSA defines brute-force attack as “[a] basic technique for trying every possible key in turns until the correct key is identified.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A brute-force attack is essentially a cryptanalytic attack used to decrypt any encrypted data (which may be referred to as a cipher).</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">In other words, it involves testing all possible keys in an attempt to recover the plaintext, which is the base for producing a particular ciphertext.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Brute-force attacks need more processing power compared to other attacks. The detection of keys or plaintext at a rapid pace in a brute-force attack results in breaking of the cipher.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">A cipher is secure if no method exists to break it other than a brute-force attack. Mostly, all ciphers lack mathematical proof of security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Some considerations for brute-force attack are as follows:</p><ul><li>It is a time-consuming process</li><li>It can eventually trace all passwords</li><li>An attack against Networking Technology (NT) hash is much harder against LAN Manager (LM) hash</li></ul><p><strong>Rule-based Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Attackers use a rule-based attack when they know some credible information about the password such as rules of setting the password, algorithms involved, or the strings and characters used in its creation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">For example, if the attackers know that the password contains a two- or three-digit number, then they will use some specific techniques for faster extraction of the password. By obtaining useful information, such as use of numbers, the length of password, and special characters, the attacker can enhance the performance of the cracking tool and thereby reduce the time required for retrieving the password.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This technique involves brute-force, dictionary, and syllable attacks (a syllable attack combines both a brute-force attack and a dictionary attack and is often used to crack those passwords which do not consist of an actual word but a mix of characters and syllables).</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">The attackers may use multiple dictionaries, brute-force techniques, or simply try to guess the password.</p></div>
