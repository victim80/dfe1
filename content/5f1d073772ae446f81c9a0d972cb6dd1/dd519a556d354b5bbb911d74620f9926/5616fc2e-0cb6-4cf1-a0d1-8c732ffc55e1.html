  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">One of the shortcomings of various detection programs is their primary focus on streaming text data. What if an attacker bypasses normal surveillance techniques and is still able to steal or transmit sensitive data? In a typical situation, after an attacker manages to get inside a firm as a temporary or contract employee, he/she surreptitiously seeks out sensitive information. While the organization may have a policy that does not allow removable electronic equipment in the facility, a determined attacker can still find ways to do so using techniques such as steganography.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Steganography refers to the art of hiding data “behind” other data without the target’s knowledge, thereby hiding the existence of the message itself. It replaces bits of unused data in usual files such as graphic, sound, text, audio, video, etc. with some other surreptitious bits. The hidden data can be plaintext or cipher text, or it can be an image. Utilizing a graphic image as a cover is the most popular method to conceal data in files. Steganography is preferred by attackers because, unlike encryption, it is not easy to detect.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, attackers can hide a keylogger inside a legitimate image; therefore, when the victim clicks on the image, the keylogger captures the victim’s keystrokes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers also use steganography to hide information when encryption is not feasible. In terms of security, it hides the file in an encrypted format so that even if the attacker decrypts it, the message will remain hidden. Attackers can insert information such as source code for a hacking tool, list of compromised servers, plans for future attacks, communication and coordination channel, etc. The forensic investigator examines the Stego-Object to extract the hidden information.</p></div>
