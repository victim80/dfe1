  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Artifact wiping refers to the process of deleting or destroying the evidence files permanently using file-wiping and disk-cleaning utilities and disk degaussing/destruction techniques. The attacker permanently eliminates particular files or the file system itself.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk-wiping Utilities</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Disk wiping involves erasing data from the disk by deleting its links to memory blocks and overwriting the memory contents. In this process, the application overwrites the contents of MBR, partition table and other sectors of the hard drive with characters such as null character or any random character several times (using data wiping standards). In this case, the forensic investigator finds it difficult to recover data from the storage device. Some of the commonly used disk wiping utilities include BCWipe Total WipeOut, CyberScrub cyberCide, DriveScrubber, ShredIt, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>File Wiping Utilities</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">These utilities delete individual files from an OS in a short span and leave a much smaller signature when compared with the disk-cleaning utilities. However, some experts believe that many of these tools are not effective, as they do not accurately or completely wipe out the data and also require user involvement. The commonly used file-wiping utilities are BCWipe, R-Wipe &amp; Clean, CyberScrub Privacy Suite, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk Degaussing and Destruction Techniques</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Disk degaussing is a process by which a strong magnetic field is applied to storage device, resulting in an entirely clean device of any previously stored data. Physical destruction of the device is one of the most widely used techniques to ensure data wiping.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">NIST recommends a variety of methods to accomplish physical destruction of the digital media, which includes disintegration, incineration, pulverizing, shredding, and melting. Intruders use disk degaussing/destruction techniques to make the evidentiary data unavailable to forensics investigators.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk Formatting</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Formatting of a hard drive does not erase the data present on the disk but wipes its address tables and unlinks all the files in the file system. Later, a new file tree is set up to use with OS. After formatting a hard disk, the forensic investigator can recover data from a formatted drive.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;"><strong>Note</strong>: It is difficult to retrieve data that has been wiped out using these techniques. Hence, it is recommended that the organizations take a backup of the data on regular basis.</p></div>
