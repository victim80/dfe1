  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">ADS, or an alternate data stream, is a NTFS file system feature that helps users find a file using alternate metadata information such as author title. It allows files to have more than one stream of data, which are invisible to Windows Explorer and require special tools to view. Thus, ADS makes it easy for perpetrators to hide data within files and access them when required. Attackers can also store executable files in ADS and execute them using the command line utility. ADS allows attacker to hide any number of streams into one single file without modifying the file size, functionality, etc., except the file date. However, the file date can be modified using anti-forensics tools like TimeStomp. In some cases, these hidden ADS can be used to remotely exploit a web server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An ADS contains metadata such as access timestamps, file attributes, etc. Investigators need to find ADS and extract the information present in it. As the system cannot modify ADS data, retrieving it can offer raw details of the file and execution of malware.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Apart from using the above-mentioned methods, investigators can also use software tools to identify ADS files and extract the additional streams.</p></div>
