The command <strong>cp/proc/$PID/exe/tmp/file</strong> creates a copy of a file in <strong>/tmp</strong>.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Unlike Windows, Linux can access and retrieve data from a variety of machines. The Linux kernel supports a large number of file systems including VxFS, UFS, HFS, NTFS, and FAT file systems. Some file systems are not readable in a Windows environment, and users can easily recover such files using a bootable Linux distro such as Knoppix. Third-party tools such as Stellar Phoenix Linux Data Recovery, R-Studio for Linux, TestDisk, PhotoRec, and Kernel for Linux Data Recovery can be used to recover deleted files from Linux.</p></div>
