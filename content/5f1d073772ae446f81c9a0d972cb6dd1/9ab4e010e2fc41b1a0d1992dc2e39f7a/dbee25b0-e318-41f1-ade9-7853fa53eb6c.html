Therefore, whenever a partition is deleted from the disk, the entries pertaining to the partitions are removed from the MBR partition table.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">An attacker/insider with a malicious intent may delete a partition and merge it with the primary partition.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">During forensic investigation, if the investigator cannot find the deleted partition in Disk Management, then the investigator uses third-party tools such as R-Studio and EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard to scan the hard disk to discover and recover the deleted partition and its contents. These automated tools perform full disk scan, looks for deleted partition information and reconstruct the partition table entry for deleted partition.</p></div>
