  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">Windows tracks its files/folders on a hard drive using the pointers that tells the system where the file begins and ends. When a file/folder is deleted from a drive, the contents related to the file/folder remain on the hard disk, but the pointers to the file are deleted. In other words, the deleted files can be recovered from the hard disk until the sectors containing the contents of the file are overwritten with new data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;height:normal;">This allows forensic tools such as Autopsy, Recall My Files, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro, and R-Studio for Windows, to recover such deleted files/folders from the hard disk. In SSDs, the recovery of deleted files becomes difficult as TRIM is enabled by default.</p></div>
